I'm not afraid 
To take a stand 
Everybody 
Come take my hand 
We'll walk this road together , through the storm
Whatever weather , cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road 


Yeah , it's been a ride
I guess I had to , go to that place , to get to this one
Now some of you , might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out , just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'ma do something I do it ,
I don't give a damn what you think ,
I'm doing this for me , so fuck the world
Feed it beans , it's gassed up , if it thinks it's stopping me
I'ma be what I set out to be , without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No ifs , ands or buts , don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album
He's still shitting , whether he's on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first , for better or worse
He's married to the game , like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse , forget the Earth , he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt , and fuck the whole universe



Okay quit playing with the scissors and shit , and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king , you lied through your teeth , for that
Fuck your fillings , instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans , I'll never let you down again , I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise , in fact
Let's be honest , that last Relapse CD was ehhh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax , I ain't going back to that now
All I'm trying to say is get back , click - clack , blow
Cause I ain't playing around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how , I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't , this fucking black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now



And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today , I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up , I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up , I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough , now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now 

It was my decision to get clean , I did it for me
Admittedly , I probably did it subliminally
For you , so I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did , 'cause believe me you
I been through the ringer , but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye , I feel like the king of
My world , haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead , no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on , I promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof , like my daughters
And raise it , you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel , I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub , and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing at stars
I feel amazing and I'm





Lately I've been hard to reach , I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me , like I'm reaching out for you


I'm just so fuckin' depressed , I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump ,
I took my bruises , took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet , and I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow
But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today , gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes , just to see
What it's like , to be me
I'll be you , let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain , you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful , oh
They can all get fucked
Just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh , they can all get fucked
Just stay true to you , yeah , so

I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Just as soon as I walk in
It's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that then it opens the door for conversation
Like I want that I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking man servant
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of them ain't even funny like
Ha , Marshall you're so funny man , you should be a comedian , God damn
Unfortunately I am , but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell , we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes , just to see
What it's like , to be me
I'll be you , let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain , you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh they can all get fucked
Just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh they can all get fucked
Just stay true to you so

Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip them , don't expect no help
Now I could have either just
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
In every single place
Every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid

Aunt Edna always told me Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes , at least
What size you wear I wear tens
Let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes , just to see
What it's like , to be me
I'll be you , let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain , you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful , oh
They can all get fucked
Just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh , they can all get fucked
Just stay true to you , yeah , so


Lately I've been hard to reach , I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
So are you calling me , are you trying to get through , oh
Are you reaching out for me , like I'm reaching out for you
So oh oh


Yeah To my babies Stay strong
Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world , God gave you them shoes
To fit you , so put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself , man , be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny ,
Don't ever let no one tell you , you ain't beautiful
So



Look , I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance

Something's wrong , I can feel it

Just a feeling I've got
Like something's about to happen
But I don't know what
If that means , what I think it means , we're in trouble
Big trouble And if he is as bananas as you say
I'm not taking any chances
You were just what the doctor ordered


I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God , Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod , back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box , slap box
They said I rap like a robot , so call me rap - bot


But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half - cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinski feeling on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables , skill - a - holic 
This flippity , dippity - hippity hip - hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match
With this rappity - rap
Packing a mack in the back of the Ac
backpack rap , crap , yap - yap , yackety - yack
and at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow All I do is drop F bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period
Here's a Maxi - Pad
It's actually disastrously bad
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah


'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God , Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod , back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box , slap box
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard , that hard


Everybody want the key and the secret to rap
Immortality like I have got
Well , to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid
and did nothing but shoot for the moon since 
MC's get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to 'bus the rhyme'
Now I lead a New School full of students
Me Me , I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz , 2Pac , N - W - A , Cube , hey , Doc , Ren
Yella , Eazy , thank you , they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and being in a position
To meet Run - DMC and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church
And burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game
'Til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking
Little gay looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face looking boy
You're witnessing a mass - occur like you're watching a church gathering
And take place looking boy
Oy vey , that boy's gay
That's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up , pat on the back
And a way to go from your label every day looking boy
Hey , looking boy , what d'you say looking boy
I get a hell yeah from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for shit
Git out my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
of keeping up with the same pace looking boy , 'cause


I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God , Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod , back nod
The way I'm racing around the track , call me Nascar , Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park , the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton , no Asgard , Asgard


So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent , I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead
But I'm just a talking head , a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common , poodle
I'm a Doberman , pinch yourself
In the arm and pay homage , pupil
It's me
My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize
What I do though for good
At least once in a while so I wanna make sure
Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes
But sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to
Censor you like that one line I said
On I'm Back from the Mathers LP
One when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line
Add an AK - 47 , a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now
That I ain't as big as I was , but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel
With fucking cornrows
You write normal , fuck being normal
And I just bought a new ray gun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya
Like when Fabulous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag
At Mayweather's pad singin' to a man
While he play piano
Man , oh man , that was the 24/7 special
On the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to radio station the very next day
Hey , Fab , I'mma kill you
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed , 
Uh , summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber , so that anything you say is
Ricochet in off a me and it'll glue to you
And I'm devastating more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading , and I know that haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off , they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music
You make elevator music
Oh , he's too mainstream
Well , that's what they do
When they get jealous , they confuse it
It's not hip hop , it's pop
'Cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock , shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains , I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice ,
your songs you could sacrifice virgins to
Unghh , school flunky , pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself , but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
When I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue - and - cheek , fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys
Still chunky , but funky
But in my head there's something
I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and
Here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Life's handing you lemons
Make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard , be a king
Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God



Oh yeah , this is Eminem baby , back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your mother fucking mind , we represent the 313
You know what I'm saying , cause they don't know shit about this
For the 9 - 6


Ayo , my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxing , a zany acting maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son , you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely whack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming grills of roaches , with sprayed on disinfectants
Twist the necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
We disinfect then check the monologue , turn your system up
Twist them up , and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion , there ain't no time to be stare and gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland
I'm Infinite


You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm Infinite


Bust it , I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense of your elite defense
I got some meat to mince , a crew to stomp and two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies , I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coil hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble , I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one
Imitator , Intimidator , Stimulator , Simulator of data , Eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My accapella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis
And eases you mentally , gently , sentimentally , instrumentally
With entity , dementedly meant to be Infinite


You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm Infinite


Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M - O
So I'm assuming all responsibility
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic messaler , slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is specialer , My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool , it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical , tact full track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see , or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
This is for my family , the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be , cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit
I'm Infinite


You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm Infinite
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm Infinite





Yeah soul intent , checking it number one baby this week
You know what I'm sayin'
This is MC Proof


And DJ Head


Checkin' in on WEGO
You know what I'm sayin'
Ay yo we got the number one requested song , of the DAY coming up next
It's a local thing wants retilin'
It goes by the name of Eminem
And it's called It's OK


 Check it out , 
 Hey Kyu



It's a broke day but everything is ok 
I'm up all night , but everything is alright 
It's a rough week , and I don't get enough sleep 
It's a long year pretending I belong here 
It's a broke day but everything is ok 
I'm up all night , but everything is alright 
It's a rough week , and I don't get enough sleep 
It's a long year pretending I belong here 


One day I plan to be a family man happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
Till I'm glad to be buried 
And leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be planning this stuff
Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man , and it's tough
Cause man it's been rough , but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of , damaged and scuffed
My hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff , frantic and puff
Or plan to give up , the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
I'm anteing up double or nothing , I've been trouble enough
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering , see
My destiny's to rest at ease , till I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress , I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all , my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall , the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf , Q



It's a broke day but everything is ok 
I'm up all night , but everything is alright 
It's a rough week , and I don't get enough sleep 
It's a long year pretending I belong here 
It's a broke day but everything is ok 
I'm up all night , but everything is alright 
It's a rough week , and I don't get enough sleep 
It's a long year pretending I belong here 


I'm going for broke , gambling and playing for keeps
Everyday in the streets , scrambling and paying for cheep 
Praying for sleep
Dreaming with a watering mouth
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughtering house , caught up in bouts
With the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal
For these Grant's and Jackson's
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the mist of this insanity , I found my Christianity 
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best , instead of mope and depressed
Always groping a mess , of flying over the nest
To selling dope with the rest
I quit smoking cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool 
Trying to wrestle , I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic , running home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static , children with automatics
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome , I'm trying to do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth



It's a broke day but everything is ok 
I'm up all night , but everything is alright 
It's a rough week , and I don't get enough sleep 
It's a long year pretending I belong here 
It's a broke day but everything is ok 
I'm up all night , but everything is alright 
It's a rough week , and I don't get enough sleep 
It's a long year pretending I belong here 

Uh , it's ok , yeah it's alright , even though I can't sleep
Uh yeah , it's ok , it's alright , I can't sleep


 Now what you know about a sweet MC , from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC , you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

 Man what you know about a sweet MC , in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC , you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see


Yo some people say I'm whack , now if that's right 
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard , in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus  , my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke , can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming 
We elevated to new heights premeditated 
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it , and acting like you could rock a show 
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells , but you is a ho 
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate 
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate , yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate , and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes , I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered , turned on like an appliance 
Defiance , no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack 
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip - hop 
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo , you need to come with the real skills , and act like you know


So what you know about a sweet MC , in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC , you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

 Now what you know about a sweet MC , from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC , you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see


So what , you know about a sweet MC , in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run - D , you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree , a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot , so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man , kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans , packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I shout the slang , simple as A ,B ,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known , writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks , of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their 
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick , jump the candlestick , burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill , but you still ain't Jack 


So what you know about a sweet MC , from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC , you'll never become



Tonight , Tonight , Tonight , Tonight , Tonight


I'm getting mad love , I'm snuggling hugs
Druggling thugs , smuggling drugs , juggling jobs , guzzling jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex , unaffordable medical debts , huh
We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
To find babbling Max , gaffling tracks
I grapple an axe for them baffling acts
The mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax
Still in my yard when I sculpted the culprit
The tall shit that will end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet , I carried on my back 
Butterfingers is here and it's necessary to scratch it
Baby all I wanna do is swallow one and two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you 
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience



Tonight , Tonight , Tonight , Tonight , Tonight 

 
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight , we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight , we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright


Ayo , biters are like tarantulas , vandealous
Living as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this , I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
Caped crusader , taking care of undeserving lime lighters
I think a living never meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread interamentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you get socked and pushed
Talking that junk like you went black , guarded your back
Come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
When I rap I represent it and will never referee in it
Every minute so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented , come up with funk , I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly said it



Tonight , Tonight , Tonight , Tonight , Tonight 

 
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight , we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight , we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright


Eminem is heading skyward
For those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece 
of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous 
I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was
I meant it as a dis , cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you adding fuel to the fire
I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign of hell , rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchanting , with the romantic
Freaking the vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here , just be like



Tonight , Tonight , Tonight , Tonight , Tonight 

 
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight , we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight , we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright



Maxine 

 Hello
 Can I speak to Maxine
 Yeah this is me what's up
 What up
 Who dis
 Denaun 
 Yeah what's up
 What are you doing
 Nothing , just laying in bed
 Huh
 Nothing , just laying in bed
 Why
 I don't know , thinking about something freaky to do


I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her sadly , on her reputation
You're in jepordation , if you ain't got no preparation
When you step away son , she got her face done
Looking provocative , she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price , otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice , or get the urgency
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me , cause I ain't trying to hear it
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it 


Sometimes I wonder , what's your purpose In life that is
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids , shit
You living trife , got three kids at home and club hopping every night
You say it's gonna stop but it just slows down
And then speeds back to a regular pace , there is no end to this 
Mystery , whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me , but how can you say that
When you got niggas hiding in your closet
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely


I met this girl last week , she was a freak , and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas 
Big game over there and take notes , while I get this number
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said Hey Bitch
Haven't I seen you before , looked at my nigga
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
And said Oh it's like that
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started crying , and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine , so I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine two
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck
I said Maxine check this out , 
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out
Got to the crib she let me in
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
I said Hold up , and stop proceeding , you rushing things
What the fuck are you doing
So I went for my protection , took off my clothes and started flexing
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work
Before I hit it she said
3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass
I said What is it , another nigga It's ok
She said No I forgot to tell you , that I got AIDS
I got up out

 Hey , Maxine
 What
 You thinking about sucking my dick
 Yeah for a small price
 For a small price What you mean
 You know , money nigga
 You don't need no damn money , 
I can't give you no money anyways , I heard you got some shit
  What you , what you hear I got
 AIDS
  Who told you that bullshit
 My nigga Kyu , he wouldn't lie
 Well if that's the case , Kyu got it then
 Oh for real , it's like that
  Well I ain't got shit , 
so he ain't got shit , and if he do , he ain't get that shit from me , 
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga
 Fuck that , I ain't fucking with you
 No , see 
 You got that shit , I ain't gotta fuck with you
 Hold on , why it ain't even like that
 I want ya'll to get paid , fucking
 



Hey what up man
What up dog
Ya heard
Chillen , cold as hell
Yes it is , hey Busta didn't come here did he
No , hey look , you got fifteen cent
Nah , I got just enough to get on the bus , I'm broke
We gotta go to the store alright man quick cause I'm short
Yeah , we gonna have enough time to go to the store
Nah , look
You should just , how much you got there
I only got 75 , I'm sure I got a dollar know what I mean
Just throw it in there they ain't gonna know
You know what look , I'm sick of taking this damn bus everywhere man
You gotta make some moves or something
I know look , I'm trying to get rich ,
I got a baby on the way , I don't even got a car ,
you know what I'm saying
I still stay with my moms , 21 and still with my moms
Look hey , we gotta make some hit records or something ,
you know what I'm saying Cause I'm tired of being broke


Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of having a turn to earn money to burn
Mapping out my strategies to get rich huh
My desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched huh
Cause man I live in the D , this shit ain't given for free
Nothing's different to me , so what , it's easy to see
I'll be the prisoner to flee , all of this misery
I'm not wishing to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC , so listen to me , but if you disagree
You missing the key , you ain't even in the brisk of the tea
Unconditionally my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours , or a mission less course
When shit is in the stores , cause you can be a star


No matter wherever you are , you're never too far
From revenue huh , cause you can be king
You can rule the world , you can do anything
It's on you baby , cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are , you're never too far
From revenue huh , cause you can be king
You can rule the world , you can do anything
It's on you baby , cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are , you're never too far
From revenue huh

You know what I'm saying , see what I'm talking about man
Cause that's it
Yeah
A million dollars ain't even that far away man
Yo we got to get the money man , I can't be broke for the rest of my life
Yeah I hear what your saying ,
look there's got to be something better , you know what I'm saying
I can't live like this for the rest of my life man ,
bumming rides everywhere I go
Yeah , what's up with Lexus' and Land cruisers'


Yo I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handling business
I'm canceling Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust , it's true that I just choose
The few that I trust , thems the people that I still got
Fuck with gangsta fill pot , get your grill shot
The 5 Elemantz for life my man Thyme
Proof , Kyu and Denaun , we move through into time
My crews true and divine , we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded , and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man planning what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star


No matter wherever you are , you're never too far
From revenue huh , cause you can be king
You can rule the world , you can do anything
It's on you baby , cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are , you're never too far
From revenue huh , cause you can be king
You can rule the world , you can do anything
It's on you baby , cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are , you're never too far
From revenue huh

That's what I'm talking about , I'm not trying to be the player ,
I'm trying to be the man , I'm want to be President
Yo forgot that President man I'm trying to be king ,
making dead presidents , you know what I'm saying
Yeah
Getting money anytime I want owning my own businesses and all that ,
you know what I'm saying
Yeah , I'm trying to be a millionare man , hahaha , but don't all you know
You only live once
ninety six baby



Ain't no one special , special like you 
I been searching , but your the one I want in my life baby 


I'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
Missing what I remember , kissing and hugging and squeezing
Bugging and weezing , I'm having trouble when breathing
It's even tougher when sleeping
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm suffering and grieving
For loving and leaving , you all I'm thinking of in the evening
You got my knees buckling and weakening
Thoughts of nothing but freaking that I'm struggling to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speaking
I got some game that I'm preparing to run
The way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun , no matter what you're wearing you stun
Cause your comparing to none , I wanna share in the fun
I feel a passionate lust when I'm imagining just us alone at last with a 
touch 
I see you grasping to trust , but my intentions are good
The seed is passing in dust
I'm not asking to rush and answer immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me , I Love You 
Cause I just need you to see , how much I'm eager to be
Your man legally wed , your love's keeping me fed
This is easily said , so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down cause ain't nobody Like you no where to be found



I been searching , but your the one I want in my life baby 


Baby it's all on you , it's you I call on boo
Let's set a day up so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
Long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es
We'll start it out with caviar , Don Parigne
And then when it's a fact we are warm , carry on
We'll take it slow , see nobody will hurry things
I got the herbs the Bacardi and Hurricane
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
It's still all right cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
Your an incredible one that's rare , in bed with edible underwear
You look impeccable , nothing compares
I dream of freaking you , the women that will speak it too so
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
Now we all set to play , only thing left to say is
When you step away , baby but don't forget the Neglicie



I been searching , but your the one I want in my life baby 
Ain't no one special , special like you 



Attention all units , attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat , we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife , I repeat , he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution , watch your back fella's
He could be coming at your girlfriend next


There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm , look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house , he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back , I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good


We got the walkie - talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in , we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back , I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good


I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully
For what he first did to me
It's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell , on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back , I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good


I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust , and swinging at the spider - webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth , then the lights in the place went
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back , I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good


Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin , then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone


Attention all cars , attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home , I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home , how about that


I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back , I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back , I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back , I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good



Jealous 


Jealous What he mean jealous , know what I'm saying
He just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes , know what I'm saying
Girls don't buy him no clothes , He bought that ho some clothes
He don't buy me no clothes , Nigga ain't got no money , no vibe , no dick
I mean , What do I got to be jealous for
He ain't gonna make it no where , he ain't got no type of time
He has no career move , I mean


I come home every single day from working double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me , for numbers trying to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues
To many tissues , for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry , you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things
So what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
You act to be this gangsta bitch , that ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company now you always bugging me 
For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
See I've never been so sure , and your just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check them in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in , I need my second wind , Say What


Jealous , Jealousy , Jealousy 


Fuck you and what you going through
Fuck Eminem , he just mad cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothing but my and his money
Immature , Me Nigga ain't got no dick , no swang in his thang
Know what I'm saying He just mad cause I'm getting it all night
Jealous of me , know what I'm saying That's what I'm talking about
Mother fucker just trying to get his pussy


I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
Until the day I started following your feetprints
And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
It made complete sense , there's someone else you like 
So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike
And you was like ,  **I need a new nigga** 
Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
Leaving me in sorrow , Brandy never felt so broken hearted
I fell apart when you departed then the joking started
I was an open target , you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock but now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again , your acting like an ex - wife
All in my sex life , I got a message from Phife
He goes , You didn't want me to see you then , I don't want you now
Take a towel , wipe your brow , quit trying to hunt me down
You run me down and now your trying to apologize
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size , you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house ya'll , Fellas sing it


Jealous , Jealousy , Jealousy 



Eminem


No


Eminem


Nooo


Wake the fuck up motherfucker


What do you want from me


Remember me


I killed you


Thought I was dead , didn't you


WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME


I'm alive


Oh god


Get up


No


Get up and look in the mirror


I don't want to


Look in the mirror to see your reflection


LEAVE ME ALONE


LOOK IN THE MIRROR , YOU'RE NOTHING , YOU'RE NOTHING WITHOUT ME
LOOK IN THE MOTHERFUCKING MIRROR


NOOOOO 





Warning , this shit's gon be rated R , restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck It's self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma , Bitch you got a sick kid
Arrested , molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors , sunglasses and disguises
Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr Hyde and Mr Jekyll , disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
Murder Murder Redrum
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from
Inebriated , till my stress is eleviated
How in the fuck can Eminem and shady be related
Illiterate , illigitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter , hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out  killed the bitch and did her
Use to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was little'er
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fuckin Bette Midler
Sniper , waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler
Didn't Ya Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her


 I'm low down and I'm shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
and ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

I lace tunes , I'm out this world like Space Moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits , dipshits
Doing whippits , passed out like Sanford snippits
Where's the weed , I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Mix it up with cocaine so her can't forget it
Fuck it , maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
Losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke , and left rich
Walking bio - hazard causing wreckage
Smoked out like Eckridge
Band just making my neck itch
What the fuck Gimme the tech bitch
You just lost your tip , there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap hips , support domestic violence
Beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking , is Dirty Dozen's really dust smoking
If all your shit's missing , than probably one of us broke in



My head's ringing , like it was Spider Sense tingling
Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game , put the second string in
This Brandy got my swinging
Bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent , toking microphones with Broken English
Make your mama be like Ohh This is good Who sing this
Slim Shady , his tape is dope , I love it
It's rugged , but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit
It was predicted by a medic
I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic
Living off liquid Triametic
Pathetic , but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicing , I think I might have just took too much Anasin
Frozen Manaquin , posted stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying , God is that you
Somebody help me , before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for and IV
Motherfuck JLB , they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it ends , the closest they gon come is Tupac
It's politics , it's all a fix
Setup by these white blue collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks





Life by Marshall Mathers
What is life
Life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
And everytime you think you gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies , with secret indentities
and disguises , to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin
What is money
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down
What is life
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini - thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing YOUR shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off
I'm tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wanders why I'm smartin off
I'm tired of being fired everytime I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery , and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand , I'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on , while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough , because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of being white trash , broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM , tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin half the skill as me
saying they wasn't feeling me on Nobody's As Ill As Me
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of J - L - B saying Where Hip - Hop Lives

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery , and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand , I'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on , while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough , because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

You know what I'm saying
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive
Know what I'm sayin
I rap about shit around me , shit I see
Know what I'm sayin Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay , you know what I'm sayin
But ey , it's cool though , you know what I'm sayin
Just fed up
That's my word



Whoa
A get your hands in the air , and get to clapping 'em
And like , back and forth because ah
This is what you thought it wasn't
It beez the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F - R - O the double G 
And check out the man he goes by the name of er


Slim Shady , brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80 , you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzing , Dirty Dozen , naughty rotten rhymer
Cursing at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it , fuck it , while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid , crack , smack , coke and smoking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers , I'm an alcoholic 
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch , I'm coming out swinging , so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You getting knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The +Proof+ is in the pudding , just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman


So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screaming Fuck the World like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back , dirty mackin
Telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck , stoned and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck


I'm nicer than Pete , but I'm on a Search to crush a Milkbone
I'm everlasting , I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezing
Flavor with no seasoning , this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you , smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat , gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady , Eminem was the old initials 
Extortion , snorting , supporting abortion
Pathological liar , blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest , zaniest , spontaneous , sporadic
Impulsive thinker , compulsive drinker , addict
Half animal , half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an Afghan




Somebody let me out this limousine 
I'm a caged demon , on stage screaming like Rage Against The Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend , shooting up while this record is spinning
Clinically brain dead , I don't need a second opinion
Fuck dropping the jewel , I'm flipping the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfucking style , just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure , I'm sick of bitches
Sick of nagging bosses bitching while I'm washing dishes
In school I never said much , too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam , that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade , raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snorting coke and smoking weed again
I'm going up over the curb , driving on the median
Finally made it home , but I don't got the key to get in




Shit , fuck everything
Outsiders , Pace One , Young Zee
Fuck the entire world



Just the two of us 


Baby your da - da loves you

No one's iller than me 
No one , no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr Swifty from the 313


I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meanin' 
Got your whole crew doing subpeonas
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius
Murder whoever's between us , pack your heaters
Keep it close , you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like G's , you best believe this
I done made quadrapalegics outta these non - rappin rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape , it ain't no secret
That your shit sounds fake , you can't stop it my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
I'm like Two - Face , I'm painful to rappers then you can tell
From these shells , how I gotta bend 'em like route canals
I erase all trails , somethin' farther from gettin' bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself , you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence , on linkin' trials
Horrified , and keep on frontin' , repentin' and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around , vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape , how
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates , BLAAAOW

It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said no one is iller than me , unnhh


Me and Eminem and Mike
Drivin' down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication , it's 9 to 10 I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
Cuz he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady , hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost 100 pounds , I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route 
Throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell EVERYBODY GET OUT
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2 - piece
Cuz she found out I was havin' an affair with her 10 - year old niece

No one , no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one , no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313


Nobody better test me , cuz I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch , dick freshly
New Lugz , give the crew hugs , guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs , rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin' 40 - bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth , crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8 - ball , now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packin' anyways , do they Fuzz
We walked up , stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon , headed to hell in a handbasket
Talkin' shit will get you , your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked , by these fantastic
Furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters

Slim Shady , ain't nobody iller than me


I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
Ask the feds from past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads
Flashin' bread , roll down the window
Bitch you got some fantastic legs , you can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre you get him and him , Swift you get him and him
I'll get him and him , leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block , I block writers
My block's tighter , ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK
And got drop kicked , now she screamin' Stop it
Got clips to stop shit , rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop bitch , Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick
Sick a - ya'll niggaz lookin' at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggaz still don't know the top pick
I got bricks , lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks bitch
We rock shit , leave your fuckin' knot split
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits


Ain't nobody iller than me


It's the Mr Fuzzy from the 313
No one , no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one , no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz - arre from the 313

You have now witnessed 4 ill emcees
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast



All I see is murder murder , my mind state  -  
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate  -  
All I see is murder murder , my mind state
Murder , murder , murder , and kill , kill , kill 


Left the keys in the van , with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan of citizen bystands
But shit is in my hands , here's your life span
For what your life's worth this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and live a nice land
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash bitch , I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin'
I want the whole pie , I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin' , clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets ya description an' sketches ya
The connection was the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cuz I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell an' hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back , stepped in wavin' the Mac
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack
Grabbed her by the throat , it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin' for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin' Freeze
But I'm already wanted for sellin' keys
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots , they bust back
Hit the square in the chest , he wasn't wearin' a vest



Left the house , pullin' out the drive backin' out
Need a backin' out this lady's Jag started blackin' out
Pulled the Mac - 10 out , stuck it in her face
Shut ya yackin' mouth before I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair , smacked her up
Thinkin' fuck it , mug her while you're there , jacked her up
Stole her car , made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl on Set It Off did
Jetted off kid , stole the whip , now I'm a criminal
Drove in thru somebody's yard , dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin': Son , go in and call the police
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a nick before
Smashed the window , grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And colliding with an 80 - year old lady with groceries
There goes the cheese , eggs , milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds , it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped , must - a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must - a dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up , I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin' TRUCE TRUCE
Surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnopps







Hi My name is  My name is 
My name is  Slim Shady
Hi My name is  My name is 
My name is  Slim Shady

Ahem excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class for one second


Hi kids Do you like violence 
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids 
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did 
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is 
My brain's dead weight , I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate 
And Dr Dre said , Slim Shady you a basehead
Uh - uhhh So why's your face red Man you wasted
Well since age twelve , I've felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut 
I don't give a fuck , God sent me to piss the world off




My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot , next semester I'll be thirty - five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser , chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers 
Walked in the strip club , had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender , then stuck my dick in her tip cup
Extraterrestrial runnin' over pedestrians
In a space ship while they screaming at me: LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS
Ninety - nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do 
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her 
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans 
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph

So I signed it: 'Dear Dave , thanks for the support , ASSHOLE'




Stop the tape This kid needs to be locked away 
Dr Dre , don't just stand there , OPERATE
I'm not ready to leave , it's too scary to die 
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive 
Am I coming or going I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka  -  dare me to drive 
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years , and my palms are too hairy to hide 
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk 
I spit when I talk , I'll fuck anything that walks 
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me mom 
You ain't got no tits 
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head 
I'm steaming mad 
And by the way when you see my dad 
Tell him that I slit his throat , in this dream I had







Meet Eddie , twenty - three years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going ,
he decides to rob a liquor store

But on his way in , he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly , his conscience comes into play



Alright , stop 
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence 
I'm your motherfuckin conscience


That's nonsense
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress , and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay 
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blade


Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk , she's older than George Burns


Fuck that Do that shit Shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit Are you that rich
Why you give a fuck if she dies Are you that bitch
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids


Man , don't do it , it's not worth it to risk it 
Not over this shit  Drop the biscuit 
Don't even listen to Slim yo , he's bad for you












Meet Stan , twenty - one years old 
After meeting a young girl at a rave party ,
things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again , his conscience comes into play 


Now listen to me , while you're kissin her cheek
and smearin her lipstick , I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe

Yo , look at her bush does it got hair 
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there

No , but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest

Man fuck that , hit that shit raw dawg and bail





Meet Grady , a twenty - nine year old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work ,
he walks in the door of his trailer park home
to find his wife in bed with another man




Alright calm down , relax , start breathin


Fuck that shit , you just caught this bitch cheatin
While you at work she's with some dude tryin to get off
FUCK slittin her throat , CUT THIS BITCH'S HEAD OFF


Wait What if there's an explanation for this shit

Alright Shady , maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy


Okay Thought about it , still wanna stab her
Grab her by the throat , get your daughter and kidnap her
That's what I did , be smart , don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped DEE BARNES


What'chu say 
I'ma kill you motherfucker


Uhhh - aahh Temper temper
Mr Dre Mr NWA
Mr AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent


Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there , done that aw fuck it
What am I sayin Shoot em both Grady , where's your gun at 




 Scalpel

 Sponge
 Here
 Wait he's convulsing , he's convulsing
 Ah
 We're gonna have to shock him
 Oh my Oh my God
 We're gonna have to shock him
 Oh my God


These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts , Nurse we're losin him , check the pulse
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny lookin white boy , scrawny and always ornery
Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on me
And I might snap , one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
 My first day in junior high , this kid said ,
It's you and I , three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die
I looked at my watch it was one twenty
I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me
He said , Don't try to run from me , you'll just make it worse
My palms were sweaty , and I started to shake at first
Something told me , Try to fake a stomach ache it works
I screamed , Owww My appendix feels like they could burst
Teacher , teacher , quick I need a naked nurse
 What's the matter
 I don't know , my leg , it hurts
 Leg I thought you said it was your tummy
 Oh , I mean it is , but I also got a bum knee
 Mr Mathers , the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt , you're gonna get some extra homework
 But don't you wanna give me after school detention
 Nah , that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him



Brain damage , ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin
But everywhere I go they keep playin my song


Brain damage
Way before my baby daughter Hailey
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious , cause his father boxes
so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose ,
Soaked my clothes in blood , grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him , We shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave , he kept chokin me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said , You gonna die honkey
The principal walked in 
and started helpin him stomp me
I made them think they beat me to death
Holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects , brooms , and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice ,
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin you back bully Now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
and beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood
Knocked him down , stood on his chest with one foot
 Made it home , later that same day
Started reading a comic , and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin to read
I went deaf , and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin , What are you on , drugs
Look at you , you're gettin blood all over my rug 
She beat me over the head with the remote control
opened a hole , and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed , Look bitch , what have you done
 Oh my God , I'm sorry son
 Shut up you cunt I said , Fuck it
Took it and stuck it back up in my head
then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck




Brain damage
It's brain damage
I got brain damage
It's brain damage
It's probably brain damage
It's brain damage
Brain damage
I got brain damage



Life by Marshall Mathers
What is life
Life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
And everytime you think you gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies , with secret indentities
and disguises , to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin
What is money
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down
What is life
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini - thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing YOUR shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off
I'm tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wanders why I'm smartin off
I'm tired of being fired everytime I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery , and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand , I'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on , while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough , because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of being white trash , broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM , tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin half the skill as me
saying they wasn't feeling me on Nobody's As Ill As Me
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of J - L - B saying Where Hip - Hop Lives

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery , and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand , I'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on , while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough , because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

You know what I'm saying
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive
Know what I'm sayin
I rap about shit around me , shit I see
Know what I'm sayin Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay , you know what I'm sayin
But ey , it's cool though , you know what I'm sayin
Just fed up
That's my word



Just the two of us

Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better

OK , I'm going to attempt to drown myself 
You can try this at home 
You can be just like me

Mic check one two we recordin 
I'm cancerous , so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I strangled you to death then I choked you again
Then break your fuckin legs till your bones poke through your skin
You beef wit me , I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer , and beat yer ass legally
I get you blunted off of funny home grown
Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
 So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie AND get fucked more than the President does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin tonsils out and fed her sherbet 
My nerves hurt , and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads 
Every girl I ever went out wit is goin lez
Follow me and do exactly what the song says:
smoke weed , take pills , drop outta school , kill people and drink
And jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white , ignorin skill
Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed , y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white , I don't even exist
I get a clean shave , bathe , go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down , how do I wave
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave

Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I slap women and eat shrooms then OD
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me

Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door , must have been Ron Gold'
Jumped behind the door , put the orgy on hold
Killed em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco 
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray an Aerosol can up at the ozone layer 
My rap style's warped , I'm runnin out the morgue
witcha dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon wit a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm bout as normal as Norman Bates , with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother are you there I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
Will someone explain to my brain that I just severed
a main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain
I take a breather and sighed; either I'm high , or I'm nuts
Cause if you ain't tiltin this room , neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass 
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with
I bought Cage's tape , opened it , and dubbed over it

I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I've been with 10 women who got HIV
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me










I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault


I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
with first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan  -  -  an ex - heroin addict who just stoped usinwas into bosse and
alternative music told me she was about to use it agzin I said wiat first

Yo Sue

I just wanted to make you appreciate nature

I gotta go find Dave he's the one who gave me these
John , where's Dave at before I bash you
 He's in the bathroom; I think he's takin a crap dude
Dave Pull up your pants , we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talkin to plants
choppin her hair off , and there's only two days left 
of Spring Break , how long do these things take to wear off
 Well it depends on how many you had I took three she ate the other
twenty - two caps Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs ,drinking lysol
She's gonna die dude I know and it's my fault
My god



My God , I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry Susan please wake up
Please Please wake up What are you doing
You're not dead You're NOT dead
I know you're not dead



Hmm - hmm - hmhmhmmhm ahhh , whooooo Shit

Yo , mic check
Testing one , two , um twelve


This is my dance song 
Can you hear me


Aight , ay turn my headphones up



My favoite color is red , like the blood shed
from Kurt Cobain's head , when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin at my shishkabob
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve

You thought I was livid , now I'm even more so
Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe {*wolf whistle*}
I'm in the fourth row , signin autographs at your show

I just remembered that I'm absent minded
Wait , I mean I've lost my mind , I can't find it
I'm freestylin every verse that I spit
cause I don't even remember the words to my shit 
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
and gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You wanna get high , here bitch just sniff this

Cum on everybody  -  -  get down tonight 


Yo yo yo yo yo
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
Cause I don't give a fuck , like my middle finger was stuck
and I was wavin it at everybody screamin , I suck 
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
and yell out loud , All y'all get the hell out now
Fuck rap , I'm givin it up y'all , I'm sorry

I'm bored out of my gourd  -  -  so I took a hammer 
and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick sick bastard
who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket 
One Excederin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
 And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit

Cum on everybody  -  -  get down tonight 


Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin Beastie Boy {*wolf whistle*}
So I told em I was Mike D
They was like , Gee I don't know , he might be
I told em , Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert
I'll be standin by the Loch Ness Monster  peace out 
Then I jetted to the weed house
Smoked out til I started bustin freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib , put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick 
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbing , deceitful , and shady
I want the money , the women , the fortune , and the fame
That means I'll end up burning in hell scorching in flames
That means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name
There's lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
I got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em 
I'm screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot 'em
Holding two glocks , I hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
And the rings you're wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em I could be taking them to shops to pawn them
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em
'Cause I never went gold off one song
I'm running up on someone's lawn with guns drawn





I don't know why this world keep turning
Round and Round
But I wish it would stop , and let me off right now

Yes man
As the World Turns
We all experience things in life
Trials and Tribulations
That we all must go through
When someone wants to test us
When someone tries our patience


I hang with a bunch of hippies
and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches
and light up like jack - o - lanterns
Outsiders baby , and we suing the courts
Cause we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
They never should've booted me out of reform school
Deformed fool ,taking a shit in a warm pool
They threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me , I got a twin 
It all started when my mother took my bike away
Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that , It was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin teachers , and jacking off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman , dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson , I'll past the test guessing
And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead ,
He'll never last , the only class he'll pass is phys ed
May be true , till I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps , she needed Slim Fast 
Yeah bitch you so big you walked into big Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in the headlock , then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transforming 
It began storming , I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
Grabbed that bitch by her hair
Drag her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach , its too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop



As the World Turns
These are the days of our lives
These are the things that we must go through
Day by day


We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsiders , and we suing the courts
Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Hypochondriac , hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor , standing by a pale of garbage
Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch
I met a slut and said What up , its nice to meet ya
I'd like to treat ya to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month
But if you care to join me , I was bout to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed , no phillies , or no papers
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So gimme all your money
And don't try nothing funny
Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me
I went to grab my gun
That's when her ass put it on me
Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors
Started causing a scene
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washing machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank god I was smocking crack all day
And doped up off coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her
But so I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in
And shot her fucking porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
That's when I seen the bedroom door shut
I know you're in there bitch I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now
She said Come in , its unlocked
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watching gay porn
She said Come her big boy , lets get acquainted
I turned around to run , twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed , nothing could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg No , please let go
But she swallowed my fucking leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left , now I'm hoppin around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just trying to buy me some time , then I remembered this magic trick
Den Den Den Den Den Den , Go go gadget dick
Whipped that shit out , and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted Now bitch , lets see who gets the best
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death 
Come here bitch
Come here
Take this motherfucking dick
Bitch , come here



And as we go along
Throughout the days of our lives
We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
That we must go through
These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere
Every day
Every single day the world keeps turning



Who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough 
Told you how to slap dicks and murder your girl 
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed , Fuck the world
 so come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me twenty - five times in the same spot 
I think I got a generation brainwashed
to pop pills and smoke pot til they brains rot 
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot , and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop 
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy , I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make em fear you 'fore you make em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you

I got mushrooms , I got acid , I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need , some good weed to set you free
You know me , I'm your friend , when you need a minithin
 I'm Shady


I like happy things , I'm really calm and peaceful 
I like birds , bees , I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful 
like when my teacher sucked my wee - wee in preschool 
The ill type , I stab myself with a steel spike
while I blow my brain out , just to see what it feels like
cause this is how I am in real life 
I don't want to just die a normal death , I wanna be killed twice 
How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat
when they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet 
So bring the money by tonight  -  cause your wife 
said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life 
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school 
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter

I got mushrooms , I got acid , I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need , some good weed to set you free
You know me , I'm your friend , when you need a minithin
 I'm Shady


Yo I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it 

Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit 

People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit 
But they love it when you make your business public
so fuck it , I've got herpes while we on the subject 
And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it
cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin when I say it
 -  -  Well , I do take pills , don't do speed
Don't do crack  don't do coke , I do smoke weed 
Don't do smack , I do do shrooms , do drink beer 
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead  she's still alive and bitchin 
And I don't have herpes , my dick's just itchin
It's not syphilis , and as for being AIDS infested
I don't know yet , I'm too scared to get tested

I got mushrooms , I got acid , I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need , some good weed to set you free
You know me , I'm your friend , when you need a minithin
 I'm Shady
 I told you I was Shady

Y'all didn't wanna believe me
I'm Shady
 And that's my name



I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know , there's a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago , two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em
Quickest damn gun - slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold - blood
That old saloon there was their little home away from home
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 5'9


I don't speak , I float in the air wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person , I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And a noise is spread , picked up and transmitted through Royce's head
Trap him in his room , possess him and hoist his bed
Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said


Who hard Yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil
Intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal , I'm not a fair man
Disgraced the race of an atheist
Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords
I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over - worked , it's like the Nazis and the Nation
Collaborating attempting to take over the Earth


Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil , and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law cause I don't agree with police either 
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasing rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain

No I'm not , I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
Cause I can't find a decent vein


The disaster with dreads
I'm bad enough to commit suicide
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger , it's funny , actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
Cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred , man until they joint chains
While slipping bullets at point - blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it , murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whipping human ass , throwing blows , cracking jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze , dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazing MCs , at the same time amazing MCs
Somehow , MCs ain't that eyebrow - raising to me
From all of angles of us , flash a Mack loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt



Hello  Aiyyo what's up 
STOP , THEY KNOW IT'S US


I used to be a loudmouth , remember me
I'm the one who burned your house down , well I'm out now
And this time I'm coming back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm getting ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe


Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil , and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful , see you in hell for the sequel
 See you in hell
Wall Street , Royce Da 5'9 , Slim Shady
See you in hell for the sequel 
Bad Meets Evil , what 


And so that's the story when Bad meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law - abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon
But their spirits still live on till this day
Shhh wait , did y'all hear that




A lot of people ask me am I afraid of death
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
that I do all types of retarded shit
Look , I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you Good
Cause I still don't give a fuck

I'm zonin off of one joint , stoppin a limo
Hopped in the window , shoppin a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue , what year is this
Fuck a needle , here's a sword , bodypierce with this
Livin amuk , never givin a fuck
Gimme the keys I'm drunk , and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in a cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re - open your scab 
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin full clips and buryin guns in the mud
I've calmed down now  -  -  I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone , my soul's worn and my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin this rhyme
Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin this time



For all the weed that I've smoked  -  yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended  -  yeah fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have  -  yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can KISS MY ASS
For all the drugs that I've done  -  yo I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended  -  yeah fuck you too
For everytime I reminisce  -  yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck , y'all can KISS MY ASS


I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
I'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin another bomb 
Cause I'm crushin the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron - on
And the pants to match 
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives ,
a brain full of adverbs , and a box full of laxatives
 Causin hospital accidents
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again 




I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spend a million a track and went over my budget 
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt
I can't rap anymore  -  I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women  -  fuck bitches 
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a click  -  I'm a posse
Kamikaze , strappin a motherfuckin bomb across me
From the second I was born , my momma lost me 
I'm a cross between Manson , Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place 
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded What did that nurse say Brain damage
Fuck , I was born during the earthquake





When I was just a little baby boy ,
my momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man ,
she used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
and I realized , she was the crazy one
But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it
cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about being broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
 Slut , you think I won't choke no whore
'til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more
 These motherfuckers are thinking I'm playing
Thinking I'm saying the shit cause I'm thinking it just to be saying it
 Put your hands down bitch , I ain't gonna shoot you
I'ma pull +YOU+ to this bullet , and put it through you
 Shut up slut , you're causing too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut , OK Ma
Oh , now he's raping his own mother , abusing a whore ,
snorting coke , and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover
You god damn right BITCH , and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
I invented violence , you vile venomous volatile bitches
vain Vicadin , vrinnn Vrinnn , VRINNN 
Texas Chainsaw , left his brains all
dangling from his neck , while his head barely hangs on
Blood , guts , guns , cuts
Knives , lives , wives , nuns , sluts



Bitch I'ma kill you You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither  -  you ain't nothing but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gonna never stop beefing I don't squash the beef
You better kill me I'ma be another rapper dead
for popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't said
But when they kill me  -  I'm bringing the world with me
Bitches too You ain't nothing but a girl to me
 I said you don't , wanna fuck with Shady 
Cause Shady , will fucking kill you 
I said you don't , wanna fuck with Shady 
Cause Shady , will fucking kill you


Bitch I'ma kill you Like a murder weapon , I'ma conceal you
in a closet with mildew , sheets , pillows and film you
Buck with me , I been through hell , shut the hell up
I'm trying to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't acid rap , but I rap on acid
Got a new blow - up doll and just had a strap - on added
WHOOPS Is that a subliminal hint NO
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend NO Eminem insult
And if you ever give in to him , you give him an impulse
to do it again , THEN , if he does it again
you'll probably end up jumping out of something up on the 10th
 Bitch I'ma kill you , I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
in a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman
Serial killer hiding murder material
in a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again , we're out of our medicine
out of our minds , and we want in yours , let us in




Eh - heh , know why I say these things
Cause lady's screams keep creeping in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem , I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
this eighty G's a week to say the same things TWEECE
TWICE Whatever , I hate these things
Fuck shots I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink
FUCK THAT I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
from fat bitch to off seventy - thousand pounds of her
from principal to the student body and counselor
from in - school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathing I'm leaving air in your lungs
just to hear you keep screaming for me to seep it
OK , I'M READY TO GO PLAY
I GOT THE MACHETE FROM OJ
I'M READY TO MAKE EVERYONE'S THROAT ACHE
You faggots keep egging me on
'til I have you at knifepoint , then you beg me to stop
SHUT UP Give me your hands and feet
I said SHUT UP when I'm talking to you
YOU HEAR ME ANSWER ME





Ha ha , I'm just playing ladies
You know I love you



My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray , but your picture on my wall
It reminds me , that it's not so bad , it's not so bad





Dear Slim , I wrote you but you still ain't calling
I left my cell , my pager , and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn , you must not - a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
but anyways; fuck it , what's been up Man how's your daughter
My girlfriend's pregnant , too , I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter , guess what I'ma call her
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie , too , I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday , but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus , too , that shit was phat
Anyways , I hope you get this man , hit me back ,
just to chat , truly yours , your biggest fan
This is Stan


My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray , but your picture on my wall
It reminds me , that it's not so bad , it's not so bad


Dear Slim , you still ain't called or wrote , I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad  -  I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to , but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man , he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you ,
four hours and you just said , No
That's pretty shitty man  -  you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man , he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though , I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver  -  you said if I'd write you
you would write back  -  see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither;
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when I have a shitty day , I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline , the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real , and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim , no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man , I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours , Stan
 -  -  PS
We should be together , too


My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray , but your picture on my wall
It reminds me , that it's not so bad , it's not so bad


Dear Mister I'm - Too - Good - To - Call - Or - Write - My - Fans ,
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word  -  I don't deserve it
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you , I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now , I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim , I drank a fifth of vodka , you dare me to drive
You know the song by Phil Collins , In the Air Tonight
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didn't , then Phil saw it all , then at a show he found him
That's kinda how this is , you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late  -  I'm on a 1000 downers now , I'm drowsy
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim , we coulda been together , think about it
You ruined it now , I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me
See Slim;  Shut up bitch I'm trying to talk
Hey Slim , that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk ,
But I didn't slit her throat , I just tied her up , see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more , and then she'll die , too
Well , gotta go , I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit , I forgot , how'm I supposed to send this shit out
 
   


My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray , but your picture on my wall
It reminds me , that it's not so bad , it's not so bad


Dear Stan , I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now , how far along is she
Look , I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother ,
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show , I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists , too
I say that shit just clowning dogg ,
c'mon  -  how fucked up is you
You got some issues Stan , I think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter , I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself , I think that you'll be doing just fine
if you relax a little , I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad Try to understand , that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk , and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape , but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it , his name was it was you
Damn



I never knew I
I never knew I
Mic check one - two
I never knew I
Who woulda knew
I never knew I
Who'da known
I never knew I
Fuck would've thought
I never knew I
Motherfucker comes out
I never knew I
and sells a couple of million records
I never knew I
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
I never knew I


I don't do black music , I don't do white music
I make fight music , for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this {*tires screech*}
I put wives at risk with a knife like this 
Shit , you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck , with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down , waitin to straight jump out
put it over your mouth , and grab you by the face , what now
Oh  -  you want me to watch my mouth , how
Take my fuckin eyeballs out , and turn em around
Look  -  I'll burn your fuckin house down , circle around
and hit the hydrant , so you can't put your burning furniture out
 I'm sorry , there must be a mix - up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked
 Fuck that , take drugs , rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs , men who wear make - up
Get aware , wake up , get a sense of humor
Quit tryin to censor music , this is for your kid's amusement
 But don't blame me when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin him  -  apparently you ain't parents



Cause I never knew I , knew I would get this big
I never knew I , knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd , get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd , get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I , knew I would get this big
I never knew I , knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd , get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd , get him to hit this bitch


So who's bringin the guns in this country 
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week , I seen a Schwarzaneggar movie
where he's shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi
I sees three little kids , up in the front row ,
screamin Go , with their 17 - year - old Uncle
I'm like , Guidance  -  ain't they got the same moms and dads
who got mad when I asked if they liked violence
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the make - up you allow your 12 - year - old daughter to wear
 So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
when his bus driver's screamin at him , fuckin him up worse

And fuck was the first word I ever learned
up in the third grade , flippin the gym teacher the bird 
So read up , about how I used to get beat up
peed on , be on free lunch , and change school every 3 months
My life's like kinda what my wife's like 
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin ass every night , Ike
So how much easier would life be
if 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me




I never knew I knew I'd
have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth , do I
Fuck shit ass bitch cunt , shooby - de - doo - wop 
Skibbedy - be - bop , a - Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono , skis horses and hittin some trees 
How many retards'll listen to me
and run up in the school shootin when they're pissed at a
teach - er , her , him , is it you is it them
Wasn't me , Slim Shady said to do it again
Damn How much damage can you do with a pen
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
if you woulda been , in my shoes , who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin that you woulda bought
that woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it  -  I ain't know if you'd do it or not




How the fuck was I supposed to know



Whatever
Dre , just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo this song is for anyone fuck it
Just shut up and listen , aiyyo

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this  -  on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensing these sentences
Getting this stress that's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully 
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone , when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
Do not come and speak to me 
I don't know you and no ,
I don't owe you a motherfucking thing
I'm not Mr N'Sync , I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr Friendly , I can be a prick
If you tick me my tank is on empty 
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm lifting you 10 feet  in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer , file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you 
I don't mean to be mean , but that's all I can be is just me


And I am , whatever you say I am
If I wasn't , then why would I say I am
In the paper , the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am , whatever you say I am
If I wasn't , then why would I say I am
In the paper , the news everyday I am
I don't know , it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father ,
I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense it's constant
And , Oh , it's his lyrical content  - 
 -  the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me 
So I point one back at 'em , but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb , it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck , when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull , 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn  and the heroin
Where were the parents at And look where it's at
Middle America , now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see , an upper class city
Having this happening 
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way 
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burning and I have returned


And I am , whatever you say I am
If I wasn't , then why would I say I am
In the paper , the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am , whatever you say I am
If I wasn't , then why would I say I am
In the paper , the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label , let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on My Name is 
And pigeon - holed into some pop - py sensation
That got me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience 
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent , and grab on my balls , so they always keep asking
The same fucking questions 
What school did I go to , what hood I grew up in
The why , the who what when , the where , and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out
'Cause they driving me crazy  I can't take it
I'm racing , I'm pacing , I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit , in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No , I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad


'Cause I am , whatever you say I am
If I wasn't , then why would I say I am
In the paper , the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am , whatever you say I am
If I wasn't , then why would I say I am
In the paper , the news everyday I am
I don't know , it's just the way I am

Remember me 
Remember me 
Remember me 
Remember me 

For this one it's the X , you retarded
Cause I grab the mic and get DOWN , like Syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses , without boundaries
which qualifies me for the term universal
Without no rehearsal , I leak words that's controversial
Like I'm not , the one you wanna contest , see
cause I'll hit yo' ass like the train did that bitch 
that got Banned From TV  -  -  heavyweight hitter
Hit you watch your whole head split up
Loco - is - the - motion , we comin through
Hollow tips is the lead , the 45 threw


Remember me 
Remember me 
Remember me 
Remember me 

Niggaz that take no for an answer , get told no
Yeah I been told no but it was more like , No , no , no
Life a bitch that'll fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
this vet is ahead of , 
The shit is all redder , you deader and deader
A medic instead - a the cheddars and credda 
Settle vendetta one metal beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence NOPE Never leave a shred - of
I got the soul of every rapper in me , love me or hate me
My moms got raped by the industry and made me
I'm the illest nigga ever , I told you
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
Want beef , nigga PBBT You better dead that shit
My name should be Can't - Believe - That - Nigga - Said - That - Shit
Probably sayin , He ain't a killer , but I'm killin myself
Smoke death , fuck bitches raw , on the kitchen floor
So think what I'ma do to you , have done to you
Got niggaz in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do , cocksuckers We glock busters
'Til the cops cuff us , we'll start ruckus and drop blockbusters
'Round the clock hustlers , you cannot touch us
I'm gettin wires niggaz wantin me dead , wantin my head
You think it could be somethin I said {*echoes*}


Remember me 
Remember me 
Remember me 
Remember me 

When I go out , I'ma go out shootin
I don't mean when I die , I mean when I go out to the club , stupid
I'm tryin to clear up my fuckin' image , 
so I promised the fuckin critics
I wouldn't say fuckin for six minutes

My baby's mom , bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song , killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong , I keep thinkin these crazy thoughts
in my cranium , but I'm stuck with a crazy mom

Came home , and somebody musta broke in the back window
and stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
Sick sick dreams of picnic scenes , two kids , sixteen
with M - 16's and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets
FUCK THAT PBBT Tou faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
and re - appear in hell with a can of gas , AND a match
Aftermath , Dre , grab the gat , show 'em where it's at


Don't you remember me
Remember me
Remember me
REMEMBER ME




That's why they call me Slim Shady  
I'm Back   I'm Back


I murder a rhyme one word at a time
You never , heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better , get rid of that nine , it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself
I'm waitin for hell like hell shit I'm anxious as hell
Manson , you're safe in that cell , be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen I was puttin shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to , get punked and bullied on my block
'til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
 I used to give a  -  fuck , now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of suc - cess It sucks , too much press I'm stressed
Too much stares two breasts , too upset
It's just too much mess , I guess I must just blew up quick 
Grew up quick  was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong , whatever I say is right
You think of my name now whenever you say , Hi
Became a commodity because I'm W - H - I - 
 - T - E , cuz MTV was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now is it worth it Look at my life , how is it perfect
Read my lips bitch , what , my mouth isn't workin
You hear this finger Oh it's upside down
Here , let me turn this motherfucker up right now




I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe 
 My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational 
With Ken Kaniff , who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the , internet
Tryin to , lure your kids with him , into bed
It's a , sick world we live in these days
Slim for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs
Geez , you guys are so sensitive
Slim it's a touchy subject , try and just don't mention it
Mind with no sense in it , fried to get so frenetic
whose eyes get so squinted , I'm blind from smokin 'em
with my windows tinted , with nine limos rented
Doin lines of coke in 'em , with a bunch of guys hoppin out 
all high and indo scented 
And that's where I get my name from , that's why they call me




I take seven  from  , stand 'em all in line
Add an AK - 47 , a revolver , a nine
a Mack - 11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
and that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
Cause  Shady , they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way , N'Sync , why do they sing
Am I the only one who realizes they stink
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screamin is makin my ears ring 
So I just , throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that I was stickin it to Christina
Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
it'd be Jennifer Lopez , and Puffy you know this
I'm sorry Puff , but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
and have a son and a new brother at the same time
and just say that it ain't mine , what's my name




Guess who's b - back , back
Gue - gue - guess who's back 
 Guess who's back
 Gue  guess who's back
D - 12  Guess who's back
Gue , gue - gue - gue , guess who's back
Dr Dre  Guess who's back
Back back  back

Slim Shady , 2001
I'm blew out from this blunt  fuck



You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em somethin
Heh , the fuck you want from me , ten million dollars
Get the fuck out of here



You see I'm , just Marshall Mathers 
I'm just a regular guy ,
I don't know why all the fuss about me 
Nobody ever gave a fuck before ,
all they did was doubt me 
Now everybody wanna run they mouth
and try to take shots at me 


Yo , you might see me joggin , you might see me walkin
You might see me walkin a dead rottweiler dog
with it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
hollerin at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin
 Or leanin out a window , with a cocked shotgun
Drivin up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Lookin for Big's killers , dressed in ridiculous
blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off , cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
and get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin and wristwatches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
and walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
startin shit like some 26 - year - old skinny Cartman 
I'm anti - Backstreet and Ricky Martin
with instincts to kill N'Sync , don't get me started
These fuckin brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to whylin out and bein violent
Whatever happened to catchin a good - ol' fashioned
passionate ass - whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken
New Kids on the Block , sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it 
Vanilla Ice don't like me 
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me 
Then went and dyed his hair just like me 
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
and run around screamin , I don't care , just bite me 
I think I was put here to annoy the world
and destroy your little 4 - year - old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
and call themselves Clowns cause they look queer
Faggot2Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin Detroit , when y'all live twenty miles away 
And I don't wrestle , I'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
 Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck , blaow
Look at y'all runnin your mouth again
when you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road , South of 10
And I don't need help , from D - 12 , to beat up two females
in make - up , who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim Anus , you damn right , Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots



Cause I'm , just Marshall Mathers 
I'm not a wrestler guy ,
I'll knock you out if you talk about me 
Come and see me on the streets alone
if you assholes doubt me 
And if you wanna run your mouth
then come take your best shot at me 


Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me
You little groupie bitch , get off me , go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
and this fucked up head that I've got , I've gone pop
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
Oh , he just did some shit with Missy ,
so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get - Bizzy
My fuckin bitch mom's suin for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin
Shit , where the fuck you think I picked up the habit
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch , Mrs Briggs or Ms Mathers
It doesn't matter your  faggot
Talkin about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass 
So tell me , what the hell is a fella to do
For every million I make , another relative sues
Family fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper
All the sudden , I got 90 some cousins 
A half - brother and sister who never seen me
or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
Hey - hey And then to top it off , I walked to the newsstand
to buy this cheap - ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page , flipped right fast
and what do I see A picture of my big white ass
Okay , let me give you motherfuckers some help:
uhh , here  -  DOUBLE XL , DOUBLE XL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ahh fuck it , I'll even buy a couple myself




 Yeah , hahahahawhooooo , shit
 
 Guess what I ain't coming in yet
I'll come in a minute
 AyoThis is my love songit goes like this


Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark
And when it , kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the , sixth gin you're gonna probably crawl
And you'll be , sick then and you'll probably barf
And my pre - diction is you're gonna probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinning
You're beginin' to think women
are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyin' you
Get in your car , start it , and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42 car pile - up
Earth calling , pilot to co - pilot
Looking at the life on this planet , sir , no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place
I'm outta place
I'm in outer space
I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so




'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna , but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them no
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me


In third grade , all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubic's cube
17 years later I'm as Rude as Jude
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game
And every face looks the same
They've got no name
So I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want , wherever I want , however I want
However , I do show some respect to few
As ecstasy got me standing next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck spillin' guts to you
We just met
But I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too
So you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like yo , what the fuck we do
I gotta go bitch
You know I have stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run
These drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later
But fuck it , I'm on one
So let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around looking like some wind - up dolls
Shit's sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit , six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now
I'm going to try to find some more




That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably going to want to do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend Screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning
And what's a little fight
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life
Live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere
Where was you brought up
It don't matter as long as you get where you're going
'Cause none of the shit is going to mean shit where we're going
They tell you to stop , but you just sit there ignoring
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning
But you're young
You've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw
Parties to crash
Sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now , I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
Did better drugs and updated
But I've still got a lot of growing up to do
I've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done I'll be 40
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
With a bottle of Jack
Two grandkids in my lap
Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed




Drugs really got a hold of me
They really got a hold of me
'Cause drugs really got a hold of me
They really got a hold of me




Dahh - dum , dahh - dum dum
Dahh - dum , dahh - dum , duh - da - da - da - da

Dahh - dum , dahh - dum dum
Dahh - dum , dahh - dum , dumm




Mentally ill from Amityville 
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin he won't God - damnit he will 
Mentally ill from Amityville



I get lifted and spin til I'm half - twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick 
Pen full of ink , think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers 
Hash whiskey and ash til I slap bitches 
Ask Bizzy , he's been here the past six years
Mash with me you'll get in imagine this




I fucked my cousin in his asshole , slit my mother's throat
 Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sister's birthday , she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
 And bitches know me as a horny ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped , I ate her pussy while she was 'sleep
Pissy - drunk , throwing up in the urinal 
That's what I said at my dad's funeral




That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fucking idiots still 
That's why the first motherfucker poppin some shit he gets killed 
That's why we don't call it Detroit , we call it Amityville 
You can get capped after just having a cavity filled 
Ahahahaha , that's why we're crowned the murder capital still 
This ain't Detroit , this is motherfucking Hamburger Hill 
We don't do drivebys , we park in front of houses and shoot
and when the police come we fucking shoot it out with them too
That's the mentality here  that's the reality here 
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here 
While I'm holding a pistol with this many calibres here 
Got some registration and just made this shit valid this year 
Cause once i snap i cant be held accountable for my actions
and that's when accidents happen ,
when a thousand bullets come at your house
and collapse the foundation around and they found you
and your family in it 
GOT DAMNIT HE MEANT IT WHEN HE TELLS YOU



Dum , tahh - dum ta - dah - da

Just let me lay back and kick some mo' simplistic pimp shit
on Slim's shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit 
Throw on 'Guilty Conscience' at concerts
and watch mosh pits til motherfuckers knock each other unconcious
 Some of these crowds that Slim draws
is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when it's packed and fulla cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw +IS+ niggaz from Crenshaw
from Long Beach to South Central 
 Whoa , not these niggaz again
These grown - ass ignorant men with hair - triggers again
 You and what army could harm me
D - R - E and Shady , with Doggy from Long Beach
 Came a long way , to makin these songs play
It'll be a wrong move , to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long uz' , and I carry it all day
 Sometimes it's like a nightmare , just bein Andre ,
but I

You know about Dogg - ay 
Now let me cut these niggaz up and show em where da fuck I'm comin from

I'm the Head Nigga In Charge , I'm watchin you move
You're found dead in your garage , with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it , cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside , come bounce with us
Standin over you with a twelve gauge , about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the bodybag , but never in cuffs
So who do you trust They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin with Puff
Bitch , please  -  you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees  -  c'mon

pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right I'm just a criminal , makin a living
off of the world's misery  -  what in the world gives me the right
to say what I like , and walk around flippin the bird
Livin the urban life , like a white kid from the 'burbs
Dreamin at night of screamin at mom , schemin to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
that somewhere deep down , there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found , so the reason you've been seeing this me
is cause this is me now , the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me , dressin up like a nerd on TV
or heard the CD usin the fag word so freely
it's just me being me , here want me to tone it down
 Suck my fuckin dick , you faggot
You happy now Look here


I start some trouble everywhere that I go 
Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know 
I start some shit they throw me out the back do' 
Come back and shoot the club up with a fo' - fo'

And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
That was funny , wasn't it

That was funny , wasn't it

See it all makes sense , doesn't it
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced

And while this is goin' on
His son just woke up and he just walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut

So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I should have known better when you started to act weird
We could've HEY Where you going Get back here

Living in this world without you


 
Translation
So you can suck my dick if you don't like , my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck , my dick  -  ha ha
Two pills I pop , 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid - twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night , fightin with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin him
I'm like a fuckin wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds , hurtin
 Bitch it's too late
 Cause once you're hung from the drapes , it's curtains


I'm an instigator , 380 slug penetrator
Degradin , creatin murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it  for havin blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face 
With a fifth in me , when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say , Forgive me
I'm snatchin every penny  -  it gotta be that way nigga , face it
That weed I sold to you , Brigade laced it
You hidin , I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid , handin me they bracelets
Chillin in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin  -  throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined , you get socked right on site
And even at the Million Man March , we gon' fight



So you can suck my dick if you don't like , my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck , my dick
Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like , my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck , my dick


I'm a compulsive liar , settin my preacher on fire
Slashin your tires , flyin down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired , soon as I'm hired , I'm fired
Jackin my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
 Bitch didn't you read the flyer
Special invited guest will be , Richard Pryor
 Nah bitch , I'm retired
Fuckin your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped , I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin the record skip 
Lettin the record skip 
Lettin the record skip  

I'm fuckin anything when I'm snortin
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
 Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore , spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes , even my stinkin ass mom


Aiyyo flashback , two feets , two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin  nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a 'Stop the Violence' rally , I blast gats
Be your mom on publishin , get your ASCAP - ped
The Kuniva , divide up your cash stack
Run your motherfuckin pockets , ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain , bitch I snatch Shaq's
Born loser , half theif and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker , rich rappers get they Jag jacked
and found chopped up in a trash bag


We stranglin rappers until the point they can't yell
cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless , come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome , and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you , turn around , grab you and stab you
Get executed , cuz I'm a Luni
I got a Yukmouth and it's polluted
I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household , even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo , I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga , screamin Kuniva yo yo
I leave ya face leakin , run up in church 
and smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon


I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin em shake
I'm ignorant , with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
with the superintendent's daughter , my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
who got fired from UPS for tryin to send you a bomb
 I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer , get dropped , take the advancement and run
Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'til I met your fat mama , now I'm rollin in dough




Haha suck my motherfuckin dick

Bizarre kid
Swifty McVeigh
The Kon Artis
The Kuniva
Dirty Harry
Haha , and Slim Shady



A lot of people ask me stupid fucking questions
A lot of people think that what I say on records
or what I talk about on a record , that I actually do in real life
or that I believe in it
Or if I say that , I wanna kill somebody , that
I'm actually gonna do it
or that I believe in it
Well , shit if you believe that
then I'll kill you
You know why
Cause I'm a

CRIMINAL
CRIMINAL
You god damn right
I'm a CRIMINAL
Yeah , I'm a CRIMINAL


My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head
whether you're a fag or lez
Or the homosex , hermaph or a trans - a - vest
Pants or dress  -  hate fags The answer's yes
Homophobic  Nah , you're just heterophobic
Staring at my jeans , watching my genitals bulging 
That's my motherfucking balls , you'd better let go of em
They belong in my scrotum , you'll never get hold of em
Hey , it's me , Versace
Whoops , somebody shot me
And I was just checking the mail
Get it  Checking the 'male'
How many records you expecting to sell
after your second LP sends you directly to jail
C'mon -  -  Relax guy , I like gay men
Right , Ken  Give me an amen 
Please Lord , this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child , help us destroy these demons
Oh , and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
Preacher preacher , fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me , my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing cause
I watch TV , and Comcast cable
and you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from topping these charts
And you can't stop me from dropping each March
with a brand new CD for these fucking retards
Duhhh , and to think , it's just little ol' me
Mr Don't Give A Fuck , still won't leave



I'm a CRIMINAL
Cause every time I write a rhyme , these people think it's a crime
to tell em what's on my mind  -  I guess I'm a CRIMINAL
but I don't gotta say a word , I just flip em the bird
and keep going , I don't take shit from no one


My mother did drugs  -  hard - liquor , cigarettes , and speed
The baby came out  -  disfigured , ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
I'm a CRIMINAL  -  an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller , but my balls got larger
I drink more liquor to fuck you up quicker
than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word 
My morals went thhbbpp when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee
Now don't ignore me , you won't avoid me
You can't miss me , I'm white , blonde - haired
and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
in plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happened to him
Slim Shady , I'm as crazy as Em
 - inem and Kim combined  -   the maniac's in
Replacing the doctor cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather , so I'm taking his place
 Oh , that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre , you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it , eh
I'm a CRIMINAL


Aight look  just go up in that motherfucker

 Don't kill me , please don't kill me
 I said I'm not gonna fucking kill you
Hurry the fuck up  Thank you


Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank , run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes
Come back , shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die , bitches , bastards , brats , pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet 
If I ever gave a fuck , I'd shave my nuts
tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfucking chickens ain't brave enough
to say the stuff I say , so just tape it shut 
Shit , half the shit I say , I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fucking rapist in a Jason mask





America , hahaha , we love you , how many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful

Country of ours , the stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect ,

The women and men who have broke their neck's for the freedom of speech the United States

Government has sworn to uphold , or

 so we're told


I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see ,

So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me , who share the same views

And the same exact beliefs , it's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me , so many lives I

Touch , so much anger aimed , in no particular direction , just sprays and sprays , and straight

Through your radio waves it plays and plays , 'till it stays stuck in your head for days and

Days , who would of thought , standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair , with some peroxide ,

Reaching for a t - shirt to wear , that I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this , how

Could I predict my words would have an impact like this , I must've struck a chord , with somebody

Up in the office , cause congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nuthin' but problems , and now

They're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government , I'm lovin' it , I shoveled shit all my life ,

And now I'm dumping it on



White America , I could be one of your kids , white America , little Eric looks just like this ,

White America , Erica loves my shit , I go to TRL , look how many hugs I get , white America , I

Could be one of your kids , white America , little Eric looks just like this , white America , Erica

Loves my shit , I go to TRL , look how many hugs I get


Look at these eyes , baby blue , baby just like yourself , if they were brown , Shady lose , Shady

Sits on the shelf , but Shady's cute , Shady knew , Shady's dimple's would help , make ladies swoon

Baby , {ooh baby} , look at my sales , let's do the math , if I was black , I would've sold half , I

Ain't have to graduate from Lincoln high school to know that , but I could rap , so fuck school ,

I'm too cool to go back , gimme the mic , show me where the fuckin' studio's at , when I was

Underground , no one gave a fuck I was white , no labels wanted to sign me , almost gave up , I was

Like , fuck it , until I met Dre , the only one to look past , gave me a chance , and I lit a fire up

Under his ass , helped him get back to the top , every fan black that I got , was probably his in

Exchange for every white fan that he's got , like damn , we just swapped , sittin' back lookin' at

Shit , wow , I'm like my skin is it starting to work to my benefit now , it's




See the problem is , I speak to suburban kids , who otherwise would of never knew these words

Exist , whose mom's probably would of never gave two squirts of piss , 'till I created so much

Motherfuckin' turbulence , straight out the tube , right into your living room I came , and kids

Flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre , that's all it took , and they were instantly hooked

Right in , and they connected with me too because I looked like them , that's why they put my

Lyrics up under this microscope , searchin' with a fine tooth comb , its like this rope , waitin'

To choke , tightening around my throat , watching me while I write this , like I don't like this ,

Nope , all I hear is , lyrics , lyrics , constant controversy , sponsors working 'round the clock , to

Try to stop my concerts early , surely hip - hop was never a problem in Harlem , only in Boston ,

After it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom , so now I'm catchin' the flack

From these activists when they raggin' , actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch , or

Say faggot , shit , just look at me like I'm your closest pal , the posterchild , the motherfuckin'

Spokesman now for




So to the parents of America , I am the derringer aimed at little Erica , to attack her

Character , the ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns , sent to lead the march right up to

The steps of congress , and piss on the lawns of the White House , to burn the casket and replace

It with a parental advisory sticker , to spit liquor in the faces of in this democracy of

Hypocrisy , fuck you Ms Cheney , fuck you Tipper Gore , fuck you with the freest of speech this

Divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have , fuck you ,  ,

He , hahaha , I'm just playin' America , you know I love you

You 'bout to witness hip - hop in it's most purest , more rawest form , flow almost flawless , most
hardest , most honest known artist , chip off the old block , but ol' Doc is , {back} , looks like

own pilot , set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges , oranges , peach , pears , plums ,
syringes , {vnn vnn} , yeah here I come , i'm inches , away from you , dear fear none , hip - hop is in
a state of 911 , so

Quick gotta move fast , gotta perform miracles , gee willikers Dre , holy bat syllables , look at
all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham when I'm gone , time to get rid of these rap criminals ,
so skip to your lou while I do what I do best , you ain't even impressed no more , you're used to
it , flows too wet , nobody close to it , nobody says it , but still everybody knows the shit , the
most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on in eighty songs and exaggerate it all
so much , they make it all up , there's no such thing , like a female with good looks , who cooks
and cleans , it just means so much more to so much more people when you're rappin' and you know
what for , the show must go on , so I'd like to welcome y'all to Marshall and Andre's carnival ,
c'mon now



It's just like old times , the dynamic duo , two old friends , why panic , you already know who's
fully capable , the two capped heroes , dial straight down the center eight - zero - zero , you can
even call collect , the most feared duet , since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette , and
never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat , people steppin' over people just to rush to
the set , just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely , ease over these beat's and be so
breezy , Jesus how can shit be so easy , how can one Chandra be so Levy , turn on these beats ,
MC's don't see me , believe me BET and MTV are gonna grieve , when we leave , dog fo' sheezy ,
can't leave rap alone , the game needs me , 'till we grow beards , get weird , and disappear into
the mountains , nothin' but clowns down here , but we ain't fuckin around round here , yo' Dre ,

friends , same blonde hair , same rap channel , good night everyone , thank you for coming , your
host for the evening , {Marshall} , oh , ha



Where's my snare
I have no snare in my headphones  -  there you go
Yeah yo , yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against
I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes , look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me , but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now; I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you mama
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet 
I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry , but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Ha I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi - platinum selling CD
I was a baby , maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split , I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailie , and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim , I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human , but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid , no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take them bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life , I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet 
I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry , but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision
Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Going through public housing systems , victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up , now I blew up , it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma
But guess what You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her , she's beautiful
But you'll never see her  -  she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song  -  keep telling yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
Well guess what , I am dead  -  dead to you as can be

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet 
I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry , but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet 
I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry , but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

oochie walla um da dah da dah da but you gotta gotta ,

Keep movin' ,

There's more music to make ,

Keep makin' new shit ,

Produce hits to break

the monotony ,

What's gotten into me

Drug's , rock and Hennessey ,

Thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies ,

On your knees ,

Got you under seige ,

Somebody you would give a lung to be hungry ,

Like a fuckin' younger me ,

Fuck the fee ,

I can get you jumped for free ,

Yah buddy ,

Laugh it's funny ,

I have the money to have you killed by somebody who has nothing ,

I'm past bluffing ,

Pass the K - Y ,

Let's get ready for some intense ,

serious ass fucking





Dr Dre , wants to square with me ,

Nasty Nas , wants to square dance with me ,

X to the Z , wants to square dance with me ,

Busta Rhymes , wants to square dance with me ,

Cana - bitch won't square dance with me ,

I'm a soldier , i'm a soldier , i'm a soldier , i'm a soldier


Yo' , never was a thug , just infatuated with guns , 

never was a gangsta , 'til I graduated to one ,

and got the rep of a villain , for weapon concealin' , 

took the image of a thug , kept shit appealin' , 

willin' to stick out my neck , for respect if it meant life or death , 

never live to regret what I said , 

when you're me , people just want to see , 

if it's true , if it's you , what you say in your rap's , what you do , 

so they feel , as part of your obligation to fulfill , 

when they see you on the streets , face to face , are you for real , 

in confrontation ain't no conversation , if you feel you're in violation , 

any hesitation'll get you killed , if you feel it , kill it , 

if you conceal it , reveal it , being reasonable will leave you full of bullets , 

pull it , squeeze it , till it's empty , tempt me , push me , pussies , 

I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze



I'm a soldier , these shoulder's hold up so much , they won't budge , 

i'll never fall or fold up ,

i'm a soldier , 

even if my collar bone's crush or crumble , 

I will never slip or stumble , 

i'm a soldier , 

these shoulder's hold up so much , they won't budge , 

i'll never fall or fold up , 

i'm a soldier , 

even if my collar bone's crush or crumble , 

I will never stumble


I love pissin' you off , it get's me off , 

like my lawyer's , when the fuckin' judge let's me off ,

all you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off , 

i'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bet's be off , 

i'm a lit fuse , anything I do bitche , it's news , 

pistol whippin' motherfuckin' bouncers , six - two , 

who needs bullets , soon as I pull it , you sweat bullets , 

an excellent method to get rid of the next bully , 

it's actually better cause instead you murderin' , 

you can hurt em' and come back again and kick dirt at 'em , 

it's like pourin' salt in the wounds , assault and get sued , 

you can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room , 

everybody halts and stops , calls the cops ,

all you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops , 

runnin' and duckin' out the Hard Rocks parking lot , 

you'll all get shot whether its your fault or not , cause




I spit it slow so these kids know that i'm talkin' to 'em , 

give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em , 

i'm like a thug , with a little bit of Pac influence , 

I spew it , and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it , 

you motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it , 

don't even try it , you'll look stupid , do not pursue it , 

don't ever in your life , try to knock the truest , 

I spit the illest shit , ever been dropped to two inch , 

so ticky - tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock , 

listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock , 

listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen , 

motherfuckers know that i'll never be Marshall again , 

full of controversy until I retire my jersey , 

'til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty , and

Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me , 

and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity , i'm a




Yo' left , yo' left , yo' left , 

right , left , 

yo' left , yo' left , yo' left , 

right , left , 

yo' left , yo' left , yo' left , 

right , left , 

yo' left , yo' left , yo' left , 

right , left



Sayin' goodbye , sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye , sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye , sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye , sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
{Hollywood} , sayin' goodbye , sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
{Why do I feel this way} , sayin' goodbye , sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye , sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye , sayin' goodbye to Hollywood


I thought I had it all figured out , I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
Which should've been a reason enough , for me to get my stuff and just leave
How come I couldn't see this shit myself , it's just me
Nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell , to catch me
The minute shit was heated she just bailed
i'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimetere when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records , I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down
Try to get my feet on solid ground , so for now i'm




Bury my face in comic books , cause I don't want to look
At nothin' , this world's too much
I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of tylenol I would , and end it for good
Just say goodbye to Hollywood
I probably should , these problems are piling all at once
Cause everything that bothers me , I got it bottled up
I think i'm bottomin' out
But i'm not about to give up , I gotta get up
Thank God , I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father
So not a lot of good , i'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't want to follow in the footsteps of my dad
Cause I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass , man
If you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans , when I tell 'em i'm




I don't wanna quit , but shit , I feel like this is it
For me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game , this fame , in real life this is sick
Publicity stunt my ass , conceal my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns , i'm done , i'll never look at gats
If I scrap , i'll scrap like I ain't never whooped some ass
I love my fans
But no one ever puts a grasp on the fact i've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt i'd get to the level that i'm at , this is whack
This is more than I ever could of asked
everywhere I go , a hat , a sweater hood , or mask
What about math , how come I wasn't ever good at that
It's like the boy in the bubble , who never could adapt , i'm trapped
If I could go back , I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil , i'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein' ,
everything blow up and all you did was just grow
up emceeing
It's fuckin' crazy
Cause all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had
But instead I forced us to live alienated , so i'm sayin'




Goodbye , goodbye Hollywood , {Goodbye} ,
please don't cry for me , when i'm gone for good ,
{this shit is not for me} ,
so goodbye , goodbye Hollywood ,
{i'm not a fuckin' star} ,
please don't cry for me , when I'm gone for good ,
{i'm goin' back home}



Obie , yo' , i'm sick , damn , you straight dog




That's why I ain't got no time , for these games and stupid tricks , or these bitches on my dick ,

that's how dudes be getting sick , that's how dicks be getting drips , falling victims to this

shit , from these bitches on our dicks , fucking chickens with no ribs , that's why I ain't got no

time



Yo' , I woke up fucked up off the liquor I drunk , I had a bag of the skunk won in last nights

tunk , pussy residue was on my penis , Denise from the cleaners , fucked me good , you should of

seen this , big booty bitch , switch unbearable , french roll stylin' , body like a stallion , sizin'

up the figure while my shit getting bigger , debatin' on a fuck or do I want to be her nigga ,

caressin' this bitch , plus i'm checking out them tit's , sippin' on that fine shit I ain't used

to buyin' , I gotta hit it from behind , it's mandatory , like takin' hoe's money , but that's

another story , for surely , the pussy on toast after we toast , her clothes fell like bishop in

juice , the womb beater , clean pussy eater , insertin' my jock in that spot hotter than the

hottest block , don't stop , the response I got when I was knockin' it , clock steady tickin' ,

kinky finger lickin' , and can on , semen's at my tip when she moans , I gotta slow down before I

cum soon , and work that nigga , like a slave owner , when I dropped off my outfit , she knew I

wanted to bone her , she foamin' at the lips , the one between them hips , pubic hairs lookin' like

some sour cream dip , without the nacho , my dick hit the spot though , pussy tighter than

conditions of us black folks , we in the final stretch , the last part of sex , I bust a fat ass

nut , then I woke up next , like what the fuck is goin' on here , this bitch evaporated , pussy and

all , just picked up and vacated , now i'm frusturated cause my dick was unprotected , and Doctor

Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit





Now I don't wanna hit no woman , but this chick's got it comin' , someone better get this bitch ,

before she get's kicked in the stomach , and she's pregnant , but she's eggin' me on , beggin' me

to throw her off the steps of this porch , my only weapon is force and I don't wanna resort to

any violence of any sort , but what's she shovin' me for , doesn't she love me no more , wasn't she

huggin' me four minutes ago at the door , man , i'm this close to goin' toe - to - toe with this

whore , what would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce , she's havin' another baby

in a month , and it's yours , and you find out it isn't cause this bitch has been visitin' someone

else , and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back , to Michigan , now the

plot is thickenin' worse , cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a

hearse , so you paranoid at every little cold that you get , ever since they told you this shit ,

you've been holdin' your dick , so you go to the clinic , sweatin' every minute you in it , then

the doctor comes out lookin' like Dennis the Menace , and it's obvious to everyone in the lobby

it's AIDS , he ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it , so you jet back home , cause you

gon' get that hoe , when you see her , you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back , yo' , cause you love

her , you never would expect that blow , Obie told you the scoop , how could she stoop that low ,

Jesus , I don't believe this , bitch works at the cleaners , bringin' me home diseases , swingin'

from Obie's penis , she's so deceivin' , shit this hoe's a genius , she g'd us




I'm busy , yeah , fuck these bitches , fuck 'em all , get money , Shady records , Obie Trice , Eminem ,

motherfucker , new millenium shit , yeah , turn this shit off , turn this shit the fuck off



Obie Trice/Real Name No Gimmicks


two trailer park girls go 'round the outside , 'round the outside , 'round the outside

Guess who's back , back again
Shady's back , tell a friend
Guess who's back ,
guess who's back ,
guess who's back ,
guess who's back
guess who's back
Guess who's back


I've created a monster , 'cause nobody wants to
see Marshall no more they want Shady I'm chopped liver
well if you want Shady , this is what I'll give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka that'll jumpstart my heart quicker than a
shock when I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor when I'm not cooperating
when I'm rocking the table while he's operating 
you waited this long now stop debating 'cause I'm back ,
I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms Cheney but your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
they tried to shut me down on MTV but it feels so empty without me
So come on dip , bum on your lips fuck that ,
cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits Fuck
YOU DEBBIE


Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy ,
'Cause it feels so empty without me


Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed , their parents still listen to Elvis
they start feeling like prisoners , helpless ,
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch
A visionary , vision is scary , could start a revolution , polluting the air waves a rebel
so just let me revel and bask , in the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
and it's a disaster such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well I'm back 
fix your bent antennae tune it in and then I'm gonna
enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting , the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing Attention Please feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
A nuisance , who sent , you sent for me




A tisk - it a task - it , I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit , that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards , and Moby
you can get stomped by Obie , you 36 year old bald headed fag blow me
You don't know me , you're too old let go it's over , nobody listens to techno
Now let's go , just give me the signal I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope , suspenseful with a pencil ever since
Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems , everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting , but it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley , to do Black Music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy 
there's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea it'd be so empty without me



 
Kids


 
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing , it's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone , cold and he don't care
He's a problem child
What bothers him all comes out , when he talks about
His fuckin' dad walkin' out
'Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked , he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black , brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants , do - rags and a stocking cap
His step - father hit him , so he socked him back , and broke his nose
His house is a broken home , there's no control , he just let's his emotions go


 , sing with me ,  , sing for the years
 , sing for the laughter , sing for the tears , 
Sing it with me , just for today , maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away


Entertainment is changin' , intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers , a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy , only have one homie
Only this gun , lonely 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate , I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
Or they can degrade , or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us , plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune , no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you , journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you , attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have , they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me , strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously , so I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace , this shit doesn't make sense Pete
It's all political , if my music is literal , and I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldn't , I wouldn't be fit to , you're full of shit too , Guerrera , that was a fist that hit you




They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you  , and cock it too
Well if it can , then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves , we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales , you ignoramus
But music is reflection of self , we just explain it , and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it
How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids , who don't have a thing
Except for a dream , and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin - up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit , and they vibe
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it , squeeze it and hold it
'Cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on , through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can







Oh
You high baby
Yeah
Ya
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something
Uh - huh
I know what you want to hear


'Cause I know you want me baby , I think I want you too
I think I love you baby , I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl , come be in Shady's world
I want to grow together , let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby , you know I want you too
They call me Superman , I'm here to rescue you
I want to save you girl , come be in Shady's world
Ooh boy you drive me crazy , bitch you make me hurl


They call me Superman , leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now , got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down in a relationship
Save it bitch , babysit , you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit , girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip , cut to the chase ,
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games , say no names , ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man , kiss my ass , kiss my lips , bitch why ask
Kiss my dick , get my cash , I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out , I'll put you out , won't get out , I'll push you out
Puss blew out , poppin' shit , wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice Buy you ice , bitch if you died , I wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be My new wife What you Mariah , fly through twice


But I do know one thing though , bitches , they come they go
Saturday through Sunday , Monday , Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day , maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho


'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman , your Superman


Don't get me wrong , I love these ho's
It's no secret , everybody knows
Yeah we fucked , bitch so what
That's about as far as your body goes
We'll be friends , I'll call you again , I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in , we'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that , neither do I ,
I don't want to flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride , between you and I
Not a jealous man , but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do , how could it ever be just us two
I'd never love you enough to trust you , we just met and I just fucked you






First thing you say , I'm not fazed , I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyways
You're just plain old Marshall to me
Ooh ya' girl run that game
Hailie Jade , I love that name , love that tattoo , what's that say
Rot in pieces , uh , that's great
First off you don't know Marshall , at all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal , I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit , leave hand prints all across you
Good Lordy whoadie , you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have , ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab , end up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax , and slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance , don't mean to ruin your plans









Yo , I can't sing but
I feel like singin'
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy

Yeah , I'm happy
Ha Ha
I got my baby back
Yo , check it out


Some days I sit starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry

Sometimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy , oh , so crazy
Why am I here , am I just wasting my time

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes


Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me


My baby girl  keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes 'cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side

I act like shit don't phase me ,
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes , oh , no




Man , if I could sing , I'd keep singing this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes , I'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her , how proud I am that I got her
God , I'm a daddy , I'm so glad that her mom didn't 
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol - packing drug - addict who bags on his mama ,
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul ,
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breaking
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations
Now look , I love my daughter more than life in itself ,
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well , given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances , man , it's too bad , could've had someone else
But the years that I've wasted are nothing to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin':
3 felonies , 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman ,
I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs , bent over backwards for this woman
Man , I should've seen it comin' , what'd I stick my penis up in
Would've ripped the pre - nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it , it's over , there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby , baby the only lady that I adore , Hailie
So sayonara , try tomorrow , nice to know ya
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted

Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me


Woo
I told you I can't sing
Oh well , I tried
Hailie , 'member when I said
If you ever need anything , daddy will be right there
Well guess what
Daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby
I love you 





Music , reality , sometimes it's hard to tell the difference

But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids

Sike



If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow

Would you feel sorrow or show love

Or would it matter

Can never be the lead - off batter of things

Shit for me to feed off

I'm see - saw battling

But theres way too much at stake for me to be fake

There's too much on my plate

And I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away

And not say what I got to say

What the fuck you take me for a joke you smoking crack

Before I do that , I beg Mariah to take me back

I get up 'for I get down , run myself in the ground , 'for I put some wack shit out

I'm trying - a smack this one out the park , five - thousand mark

You all steady trying to drown the shark

Ain't gonna do nothing but piss me off

Lid to the can of whoop ass , just twist me off

See me leap out , pull the piece out , fuck shooting I'm just trying to knock his teeth out

Fuck with me now , bitch , let's see you freestyle

Talk is cheap , motherfucker if you're really feeling froggish , leap

You're slim , you're gonna let him get away with that

He tried to play you , you can't let him 'scape with that

Man I hate this crap , this ain't rap ,

This is crazy the way we act

When we confuse hip - hop with real life when the music stops



There ain't no getting rid of McVeigh

If so you would've tried

The only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide

I have died clinically , arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessey ,

Got drunk then I finished he

I'm every niggas favorite arch - enemy

Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef

I spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently

I'm not what you think

I appear to be fucked up

Mentally endangered

I can't stay away from a razor

I just want my face in a paper

I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres

I murder you

Danger had me turned into a mad man , son of Sam , bitch , I'm surgical

I'll allergic to dying , you think not you got balls We can see how large

When the music stops



I was happy having a deal at first ,

Thought money would make me happy but

It only made my pain worst ,

It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg

When you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls

And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends

Beggin' with they hands out

Checking for your record when its selling

When it ain't , that's the end , no laughs

No friends no girl

Just the gin you drink till you car spin you then


Damn


U slam into the wall and you fall

Out the car , trying to crawl with one arm

About to lose it all in a pool of alcohol

If my funeral's tomorrow , wonder if they would even call when the music stops



Let's see how many of your men loyal ,

When I pull up looking for you ,

With a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil

I'm revved up , who said what would lead bust your head would just explode

With red stuff I'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon

Braggin about how you shot it like a coward , bullets devour you showered you

Niggas , if I was you niggas , I'll run while given the chance

Understand I can enchance the spirit of man

Death itself , it can't hurt me , just the thought of dying alone that really

Irks me , you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk

Be smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark

Hug the floor while we plan tug - o - war with your life , fuck the tour and the mic

I'll rather fuck a whore with a knife , deliver that shit the coroner's like

You high hype poppin' shit in broad day light nigga your a gonna at night


When The Music Stops



Instigators , turn pits in cages

Let loose and bit the neighbours wrist to razors

You all don't want war , you want talk

In the dark my dogs all bark like woof

Proof nigga I'm a wolf , get your whole roof

Caved in like reindeer hoofs

Stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose

The more you all breach , the more I moves

This hill street , this is hardcore blues

Put a gun to rap checking all our jewels 

Or make the news betcha all you all move

When the Uzi pop , you better drop when the music stop



Music's changed my life in so many ways

Brains confused and fucked since the 5th grade

LL told me to rock the bells

NWA said fuck the police

Now I'm in jail

93 was strictly R&B

Fucked up hair cut

Listen to Jodeci

Michael Jackson , who gonna tell me I ain't Mike

Ass cheeks painted white

Fucking Presilla at night

Flying down sunset smoking crack

Transvestite in the front

Eddi Murphy in the back

MOP had me grindy and griddy

Marilyn Manson , I dyed my hair blue

And grew some titties

Ludacris told me to throw them bowls

Now I'm in the hospital

Broken nose and a fractured elbow

Voices in my head , I'm going in shock ,

I'm reaching for the glock but the music stops





Huh , so I'm out the game huh


Yo Dre , we riding


Whatever


Well I'm with you homie


OK , let's handle this small shit


I was born to brew up storms 'n stir up shit
Kick up dust , cuss 'til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick , went through too much , knew too much shit
Corrupt and I'm pour it on like syrup , bitch
Thick in gritz , sick and twisted Mr Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
Till the cow just tilts and tips 'n stumbles to earth
And if I fumble the verse , keep going
First take , I make mistakes , just keep it
No punches , pull no punches , that's weak shit
Fake shit if I ever take shit , I eat shit
Wasn't for him I wouldn't be shit


Creep with me , as we take a little trip down Memory Lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age


But what about Jermaine


Fuck Jermaine , he don't belong speaking mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what your saying
I'm a giant , and I ain't gotta move till I'm provoked
When I see you , I'ma step on you and not even know it
Ya midget , Mini - Me , with a bunch of little Mini - You's
Running around your backyard swimming pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with 10 or 11 year olds


Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with huh huh huh huh

Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with huh huh huh huh


Second verse , it gets worse
It gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a Dixie cup , if you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Cannabis or Dre with a Dupri
Will rub it in , every club your in , we'll have you
Blackballed and make sure you never rap a fucking again
Dre ain't having it as long as I'm here to play Devil's Advocate


If there was some magic shit I could wave
Over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And bury to make sure the tradition carries on
I would


If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't , not even if I could


From the hood and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered


And I'ma only sucker punch or swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fucking head off
Cause I know , when they get up , I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch , I'm punk - rock , no one's punk
Don't give a fuck , white Pac , so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up
And sell a mil or grow up to be Attila
Go nuts and be a killer


And I'm something of a phenom
One puff of the chron
I'm unstoppable , I'm alive , I'm on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us 


Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with huh huh huh huh

Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with huh huh huh huh


Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and alize , partying all day
But I handle my business cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble but I serve you gourmet
However you want it , you could have it your way
You fuck my night up , I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name , sending it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
Cause this is my space , you invade it
Live to regret it and you die trying to violate it
Fuck around and you'll get annihilated
Eyes dilated


Ha , like my old lady
Cause what you say is what you say
Sometimes what you mean is 2 different things
Depending on your mood , if it swings , think too many things
Little hit of Dre's weed , I can do anything
Catch a contact , then I'm gone and I'm back
I speed write and my loose leaves my launch pad


And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head
You headed West , talk shit about Dre
You better get a vest , then invest in something
To protect your head and neck


And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth
But a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death , 5 mics in The Source
Ain't holdin' my fucking breath
But I suffocate for the respect
Fore I breathe to collect the fucking check


Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with huh huh huh huh

Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with huh huh huh huh


Watch your fuckin' mouth


Yo this Timbaland , tell him I said suck  my dick








Hello boys and girls

Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships

Do you have a daddy

I'll bet you do

Daddy , what're you doing





Haha



Ok then everybody , listen up



I'm goin to hell , who's comin' with me



Somebody , please help him


i think my dad gone crazy



There's no mountain i can't climb

There's no tower too high ,

No plane that i can't learn how to fly

What do i gotta do to get through to you , to show you

There ain't nothing i can't take this chainsaw to


Fuckin' brain's brawn , and brass balls

I cut 'em off , i got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar

Inside of a hall , with my framed autographed ,

Sunglasses with elton john's name , on my drag wall

I'm out the closet , i been lying my ass off

All this time , me and dre been fucking with hats off



Suck it marshall



So tell Laura and her husband to back off

Before i push this motherfucking button and blast off

And launch one of these russians , and that's all


Blow every fucking thing , except afghanistan on the map , off

When will it stop When will I knock the crap off


Hailie , tell 'em baby



My dad's lost it




There's really nothin' else to say I , I can't explain it



I think my dad gone crazy



A little help from Hailie Jade won't you tell em' baby


I think my dad gone crazy



Theres nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me


I think my dad gone crazy



There's no one on earth that can save me , not even Hailie



I think my dad gone crazy



It's like my mother always told me


Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana ,

and codeine and goddamit , you little motherfucker

If you aint got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'

uh

Fuck that shit , bitch , eat a motherfuckin' dick

Chew on a prick , and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second

I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record

I'd rather be a pussy - whipped bitch , eat pussy

And have pussy - lips glued to my face with a clit - ring in my nose

Then quit bringin my flows , quit giving me my ammo

Can't you see why i'm so mean if y'all leave me alone , this wouldn't be my

mo

I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo

Catch a homo by his toe , man i don't know no more

Am i the only fuckin one who's normal any more



Dad





My songs can make you cry , take you by surprise

And at the same time , make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme

See what you're seeing is a genius at work

Which to me isn't work , so it's easy to misinterpret it at first ,

Cuz when i speak , it's tongue in cheek

I'd yank my fuckin teeth before id ever bite my tongue

I'd slice my gums , get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once

And die and come back as vanilla ice's son

And walk around the rest of my life spit on

And kicked and hit with shit , every time i sung

Like R Kelly as soon as bump n' grind comes on

More pain inside of my brain , than the eyes of a little girl inside of a

plane

Aimed at the World Trade , standin' on Ronnie's grave ,

Screaming at the sky , till clouds gather as Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade

And thats pretty much the gist of it ,Parents are pissed , but the kids love

it

Nine millimeter , heater stashed , in two - seaters with meat cleavers

I don't blame you , i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither






Crazy



ha ha

You're funny daddy

He cut my phone - lines

I scream for police

They're gonna hear me
when I shout



A couple of cocktails will send me to jail

But this time , when I get pulled over

No pistol in the seat

We as Americans



We as a Americans
Us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves
Look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves
Living up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Surviving by any means
We as Americans

Look at how shit has been

Im'a make buku bucks
wearing buku vests
Drama hanging over my head like a voodoo hex
I could've been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
but you know who
with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed
Now I got the Industry pissy
ever since me and Dre split it fifty - fifty on fifty it's funny
We got a buzz spreading quicker than making paper - airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the president dead
It's never been said
but I set precedents and the standards
and they can't stand it
My name should've been bastard
the shit should've been plastered
on my forehead with a stamp
I should've been blasted
I should've been had a cap pulled in my ass
but I'm too swift and fast
for that , I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot
Fuck that shit
I done seen how fast this rap shit
can turn into some pap - pap shit
that quick
snap click
but this time they got fucking auto - ma - tic
 and no one gon' test this mon
Clack

I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two Nina's under my jeans either side of my penis
under my Long Johns
under my Sean Johns
when running with the long arm of the law I'm long gone
Im'a do five years no less than that
no questions asked
it might be a good idea to stop right here
and quit while I'm ahead
already in the red
already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back
bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass
he probably gone send a task
I ain't gone even ask
they ain't gone let me pack
they ain't gone gimme my semi but I got my Whizz at

You still love me

Take this 

You ready 1 2 3 



The more you , put me through ,

The more it makes me wanna come back to you ,

You say you hate me , I just love you more ,

You don't want me , I just want you more ,

I buy you flowers , you throw 'em at me ,

I know it's sad but it's making me happy ,

The more that you slap me , the more that it turns me on ,

Cause you love me , and I love you more



It's sick , but who could ever predict ,

We'd be doin' the same shit ,

We say we do it for our baby but we don't ,

We do it for us , it's lust ,

Cause neither one of us trusts each other ,

So we fuck 'til we bust ,

Then we cuss each other , out ,

We know what it's about ,

Shout 'til I throw you out the house ,

You throw me out the house ,

I throw you on the couch ,

Punch you in the mouth ,

Fist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT ,

And apologize after ,

Laughter , pain , it's insane ,

We're back in the same chapter again ,

And it's sad but it's true ,

When I'm layin' here with you ,

There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do





Cause I hate you , do you hate me

Good cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry ,

It makes me wanna just take you ,

And just throw you on the bed ,

And fuck you like I don't even know you ,

You fuck other people , and I fuck other people ,

You a slut but I'm equal , I'm a mutt ,

We're both evil in our ways ,

But neither one of us would ever admit it ,

Cause one of us would have one up on the other ,

So forget it ,

We can make accusations , people spread rumors ,

But they ain't got proof ,

'Til they do it's just the two of us ,

It's you and me , cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me ,

But you gotta believe me to a degree ,

Cause true indeed if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it ,

Yeah I would cause the sex is too damn good ,

If I ran who would I run to ,

That would be this soft and warm ,

So it's off and on , usually more off than on ,

But at least we know that we share this common bond ,

You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on ,

I hope , the only reason that I cope ,

Is cause of that fact ,

And plus I can bust in that ,

And that's why





I could never understand it ,

That's why I don't try ,

From junior high until we both die ,

It's silly ho why must we try ,

Is it really so rough ,

That we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff ,

Try to pull each other's legs ,

Until the other begs ,

We're liein' to ourselves ,

That's the beauty of it yeah ,

Cause we truly love each other ,

That's why we always fight ,

And all we do is shove each other ,

Every other fuckin' night ,

And it's clear it ain't gonna change ,

It's pent up rage ,

We both have ,

We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else ,

We've both been ,

Someone else's someone else ,

Problem is neither one wants help ,

It's an addiction and it can't be fixed ,

Our family's mixed up ,

There's a baby sister in the mix ,

And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit ,

And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit ,

And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time ,

On every song , every lyric , and every rhyme ,

All the hoopla , all of the whoopdy whoop ,

What you put me through , fuckin' whoopdy doo ,

But I won't be made a fool of ,

If this is true love ,

You wouldn't do what ,

You did last time ,

You wouldn't screw up ,

This time ,

Cause this time girl ,

I'm telling you what ,

You do it again I'm fucking you up ,

No matter what



What you say , what you do ,

I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you ,

No matter where you run , I'll be right there ,

Right behind you , in your nightmares ,

All the flowers , and the candy ,

All the times that you threw it back at me ,

You told me you hate me , you're gonna hate me more ,

When you find out , can't escape me whore






Uncle Marshall

Will you tell us a bedtime story


Here we go


Now once upon a time not long ago

There was a little rapper about to blow

But his album came and it was not good

I think it went lead or double copper wood

So the silly little fans they were mislead

By a nerdy internet computer hip - hop head

Me and you , 'Clef , we're gonna make some cash

Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass

Hey mister , would ya care to bare witness to

The ass - whippin' I'm about to administer

To this ass - kissin' little vaginal blister

Stanabis , little Marshall Mathers' sister

And in this corner , we have the mister

Not havin' it , it's the mad sinister

Dr Evil with his bag of tricks for

this little antagonist faggot dick - suckin'

Ex - LL Cool J fan from Windsor

I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff - sta

You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya

Canabis , where the fuck you at I miss ya



Can - i - bitch , oh Can - i - bitch

Where for art thou Can - i - bitch

Please tell me what happened with

That style that you were rappin' with

Can - i - bitch , oh Can - i - bitch

Are you from Los Angeles

New York or just a janitor

From Canada Oh Can - i - bitch


Now at first I ain't really understand the shit

Picture me for a second and imagine it

Chillin' in the Bat - Mansion and relaxin'

When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners

It's Can - i - bitch on some Stan Lives shit

It creeped me out at first Man this is sick

For me , being just a sick , this conflict

Gets my dick harder than arithmetic

And I know how you jealous ones envy

I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me

The first two letters you were tellin' me shit

Like you respect me , like any other regular MC

The third letter you ask how come I ain't return

None of the messages at Shady Records you left me 

The fourth letter: Slim , you really startin' to upset me 

The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 

The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 

This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me 

So I went back and read the first few letters that said 

Some shit about a message you left 

Oh shit , that's not an E that's an A 

This dude wants to leave me a massage , he's gay 

Right away I'm on the phone with Dr Dre 

We got a bogey  



Can - i - bitch , oh Can - i - bitch

Where for art thou Can - i - bitch

Please tell me what happened with

That style that you were rappin' with

Can - i - bitch , oh Can - i - bitch

Are you from Los Angeles

New York or just a janitor

From Canada Oh Can - i - bitch 


So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib 

The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 

And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship 

Shit Oh Dre , wait a mintue that's it 

All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 

We can fly over the border Let's go 

So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed 
  Jermaine Dupri 

Fuck It , keep goin' no time to waste 

Wait , backup hit him one more time in case 

Okay  fuck now he's draggin' under the car 

Oh well , only 30 more thousand miles 

Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate 

Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 

And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' 

He couldn't have fell off that hard Ain't no way 

What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 

That Canibus turned into a television evangelist 

Plus he raps with his regular voice 
  Pet Shop Boys 

So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 

His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 

He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love 

I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done 

So I stabbed him twice , kept jabbin' , Christ 

He won't die , this guy's like a battered wife 

He's like Kim , he keeps comin' back for more 

But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw 

Hold up , 'Bis quit foldin' up 

Punch me in the chest Make my shoulders touch 

Do somethin' At least one punchline 

C'mon till the meter reads 9 - 9 - 9 - 

ty - nine percent of my fans are blonde 

'Bis c'mon answer me man respond 

Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 

Intergalatical metaphors from Mars 

Raw to the floor , raw like Reservoir Dogs 

Bite another line from Redman's song 

Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 

From a midget reaches out from under the car 

It's JD , this motherfucker won't die neither 

Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 

We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 

 Detroit bitch Talk some shit again 

Stomp him  Stomp him  

Dre alright he's dead dog , quit kickin him 

I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again 

He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 



Can - i - bitch , oh Can - i - bitch

Where for art thou Can - i - bitch

Please tell me what happened with

That style that you were rappin' with

Can - i - bitch , oh Can - i - bitch

Are you from Los Angeles

New York or just a janitor

From Canada Oh Can - i - bitch



Yo , check it out , it's fucked up , and I don't see either one of us budging


I'm withholding my anger
Though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect
That's what he says to himself
As he uses magazines to trash me
As he sits with both feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage
And it's destroying him slowly
Cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself
He has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's acting like a bully
So he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
He has no choice but to scream
And raise his voice up at me
Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared


You ain't no motherfucking 
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking 
I won't allow it , ain't gonna coward to no 
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a 
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a 

And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall


Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies
No more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers that just are
They just keep pounding at me
Now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja' 
But his ass is such a puppet
Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv's on a string
And Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough
And Murder Inc's the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks
So you ain't taking out shit
And dawg you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull a race card
And it backfires in your face hard
Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist that you fucked
When you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch


You must be taking to much 


Now what bothers me the most
About hip - hop is we so close
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J
Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugs , Slang Toungue , and Freaky Ta
It's like a never - ending cycle
That just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
I'm not excluding myself
Cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men
We learn to let shit go , but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold
When someone steps on our toes
It's no exception , it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck
About Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feeding him pills
So if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G - Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg , I'm talking to you straight
If the situation escalates
Any worse , we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap
I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Halie's name


Irvine , get your boy off that 


Get at me , dawg
Holla



Good mornin

Haha , wake your mother fuckin asses up

Yo what is the what

Well come on then , you know what time it is

Stop sleepin on my roof bitch


For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my arse whipped

Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets arse squished

I just can't get past these little pissants

That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad

And they so mad they can't stand it

Cause we can and they can't spit 

And they can't handle it like a man

And that's when it just happens

And I snap and it's a wrap , and it's a scrap an then it isn't rap is it

Hip - Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit

Maybe I'm old fashioned but my pashion 

Is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin 

Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol when I'm pissed now

But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic

Cause I'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it

Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me

You poke a stick at a pitbull you get bit B

These words stick to you like crazy glue

When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty

I'm the beatiful - est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone

Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci - dently 

I do this for Swifty , Kon and Kuniva , Bizzy & Proof are you with me



Come on an everybody come on an

Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an

Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an

Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin

Everybody come on an



 the media pitted me of a beef starter

In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one

Fuck slugs I'm walkin gloves with a shotgun

Constantly popin slugs they hot son , better not run

The bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't concious

In a house full of dog shit , 

I'ma gothic death project , you stop breathin 

You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin

It ain't about what you readin

When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins

Either that or we'll be beefin free when 

You ******* need a 'E' just to speak shit

Your leader is a botique bitch

Keep the heater where you can reach quick

I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret

****** I did it from a mind of a mental patient

When glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan

You brave



Come on an everybody come on an

Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an

Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an

Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin

Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in

Everybody come on an



Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us

But so what this beef is like 

'What tha fuck did he say in his rap Em'

I can see that he's just a punk 

I mean these niggas squeeze on me 

Please I'm seeing guts

I don't need no enemies , as my family a couple trucks

Am I empty seein them  I emtpy out them  to fight you 

In front of every reporter that I don't like

No need for metaphores I get yours across when I write

So emotions enough to say fuck you bitch , and I don't like you , WHAT 

I might as well give this up like heavy sales

And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt 

We can't self destruct

I've never felt it this much

Come on fellas , get up

We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life



I walk with a limp , pistol hangin off'a tha hip

I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith

Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick

We can't take you serious , you a comedy skit

You probaly wish that you could be out shootin them G's

But the only thing you shoot is the breeze

I can't believe you speaking on movin key's

But every time we hear you kick it 

The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets

I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack

So when they bust you better bust back 

And get your guts clapped outa your stomach

And when they want it 

I bring a hundred niggas from runave

So get your gun and if you comin

 Okay

I put the Murder Inc with lead and I'm not talking about a pencil
Look at what the fuck you dun got into
I see you found your nitch you're just a bitch with a menstral
Claiming you a murderer and spelt it wrong
You put the E before the D because that's all you on
You on Pac's dick  you a replica guy if he were still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry bitch keep it real life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins 3 deals that another nigga got you they didn't see
skills
And I ain't playing your a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be praying on his cover cause he need it
And you niggas hating shut your mouths
It's just the real niggas ain't buying that shit you put out


Doe Rae Me but we don't sing motherfuckers
So Murda Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team who expects nothing less then R 'n' B coming from that regime
Regime is a little extreme neck to neck with soldiers motherfucking marines
Ja sold his soul to sing we have witnessed teen on the TV screen chase the dream
Now that you embrace the green don't fuck with the triple beams
You're a motherfucking actor slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billy Holiday how it happen
Artists with repituares saw him in action , Pac's assassination
Def jam grabbed him , told him reenact him you'll go platinum
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins
Reenacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy
Match and destroy Shady slash Aftermath in Detroit motherfucker


Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da

Mama say mama sa Macosaca

Doe Rae Me cause we're hot and you're not
Going at me is the only shot you got
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac

Now we can skip past the mean mugs , get to the slugs
To grievance and the crying and intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga you shook ,
You're half of a half - way crook nigga get off X dick go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one and when your gone you'll only be the late fake
one
Nigga please stick the script before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch , fucking old ass ignorant innocent looking senior citizen
Built up slap you like renaissance sicitive wait a minute hold on
Is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on
A bitch made man now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream , holla and curse and go ahead and respond
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse


Slim set an impulse to get at the wanktas
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the drama for stucky and bush stones
What's wrong didn't think were strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
This real witness you all ain't caught the concept
You're talking non sense to walking bomb threats
Contacts were blown by Benzetta in the Source
Threatening at the boss you're gonna see me on your porch
Now I've got the nerve to try serve on us
But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust


Do I gotta get my nigga bugs , punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya Caddillac , Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this glock
That's right on the little shit you got left to help you eat
You not Pac's songs without laws will help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying to mock pac your mockavelli get your own identity


Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da

Obie Trice , D12 , G - Unit , 50 Cent , Hailie Jade Hahahaha

 Daddy is Ja Rule taller than me

 No honey you guys are the same size



Lord , please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done


Father , please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds


Momma had a baby and it's head popped off 
My momma don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off

Ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch

But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
 'til somebody finally took me in
My Great Aunt and Uncle , Edna 'n Charles 
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they ganged up on me and sang this song

It went a little something like
Mary had a little lamb , little lamb , little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn , Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand , understand
And by the way , where's my daaaaaaaaaaad




Predominantly , predominantly , everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white , predominantly black , but what about me
Where does that leave me Well I guess that I'm between predominantly
Both of 'em , I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting , what do I look like , a comedian to you
Do you think that I'm kidding What do I look like some kind of idi - 
Wait a minute , shit , don't answer that  -  why am I so misunderstood
Why do I go through so much bullshit , it's such bullshit , it's tush mull bisch
Woe is me , there goes poor Marshall again whinin about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad he never had , and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict , and his ex - wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it , as bad as that Mr Mathers , claims he had it
I can't imagine it , that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it
Shit , if you only knew the half of it




Evil deeds , while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned , mom , please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn , never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus , why you not comin' this year again
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale , I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me , there's people everywhere
I don't even know why they feel like they know me cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go , but life is like a merry - go - round
Here we go now , doe - se - doe now , curtains up , the show must go
Now ring around the rosie , the show's over , you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me , this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on , this ain't what I chose to be
So please God , give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'til I pass 50 back the baton , the camera's on , my soul is gone






There's not much you could do or say to phase me

People think I'm a little bit crazy

I get it from all angles , even occasionally Doc Dre - zie'll

Have to step in every once in a while to save me

To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things

Sometimes I forget what other people just may think

A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me

If they heard some shit , I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me

I maybe a little too fast paced and racy

Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times

cuz I say so many rhymes , it may seem like I'm goin too fast cuz my mind is racing

And I could give a fuck what category you place me

Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone

As long as you place me amongst one of them greats

When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay - Z

For every single die hard fan who embraced me

I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me

And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me

Believe it or not , I thank my mom for how she raised me

In the neighborhood daily , they jumped and chased me

It only made me what I am today , see

Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me

You ain't gonna make or break me

Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake , G

You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening

Cuz sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me

And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me

You had all this time to think about it

Now don't pussy out and try to about face me

Cuz I've been patiently waiting for the day

That we finally meet in the same place to see



No matter how many battles I been in and won

No matter how many magazines on my nuts

No matter how many MC's I eat up

Ooh ooh , it's never enough



My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it

Uh oh , it gets worse when I go back to the basics

You go say the wrong shit and get your face split

The smell of victory , love it so much I can taste it

I spot my target , blaze it , direct hit

Graze it , your peace talk , save it

You shit sounds dated , you're overrated

I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers

If I'm the best and the worst , then God's gift is a curse

Soldier trained to destroy , you payin' attention boy

I spit shit , slick shit , so quick you miss it

To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic

My music is a drug , press play , you ain't gotta sniff it

Chew it or pop it , roll a bag or chop it

Get your high over and over , but you gotta cop it

When it's hot , it's hot

Your hatin' is undeniable , stop it






What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough If you wish to be

saved , not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls if or

which over We seem to be approaching an age of the gross We all have this idea that we should

move up from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better



Come on , let's cut the bullshit enough

Let's get it started , let's start addressing this issue and open it up

Let's take this shit back to basement

And we can discuss statements thats made on this tape

And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love

The music that we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of tryna destroy

Let's rewind it to 89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit

Crossing 8 Mile into Warren , into hick territory

I'd like to share a story , this is my story and cant no body tell it for me

You will well inform me , I am well aware that I don't belong here

You've made that perfectly clear , I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere

From Bel - Air shopping center just for stopping in there

From the black side all the way to the white side

OK there's a bright side a day that I might slide

You may call it a past I call it hauling my ass

Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks

Oh them railroad tracks , them old railroad tracks

Them good old notorious oh well known tracks



So lets go back

Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode

Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place

I once used to call home sweet home



I roam the streets so much they call me a drifter

Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitch hike

Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 mile and Van Dyke

And steal a god damn bike from somebody's backyard

And drop it off at the park that was the half way mark

To meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark

To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's

Thats about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps

At Osbourne handing out some flyers , he was doing some talent shows

At Centerline High , I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime

He looked at me like I'm out my mind shook his head like white boys don't know how to rhyme

I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place

And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike

We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit with compound syllables sound combined

From that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line



So lets go back

Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode

Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place

I once used to call home sweet home



My first year in 9th grade , can't forget that day at school

It was cool till your man MC Shan came through

And said that Puma's The Brand 'cause the clan makes troops

It was rumors but man , god damn , they flew

Must've been true because man we done banned they shoes

I had the new ones the Cool J , Ice land swayed too

And we just through them in the trash like they yesterday's news

Guess who came through next , X - clan debut

Professor X vanglorious exists in a state of red , black , and green

With a key sissies now with this being a new trend

We don't fit in crackers is out with Cactus albums

Blackness is in , African symbols and medallions

Represents black power and we ain't know what it meant

Me and my man Howard and Butter , we would go to the mall with 'em

All over our necks like we're showing 'em off not knowing at all

We was being laughed at you ain't even half black

You ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that

And that Flavor Flave clock we gonna have to snatch that

All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement

saying how we hate this , how racist but dope the x clan's tape is

Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time

She was tryna two time me and there was this black girl

At our school who thought I was cool cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me

And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus

The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs

The bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull it

Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time

But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy

And thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl

But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad

But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize

I was wrong cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a hoe



So lets go back

Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode

Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place

I once used to call home sweet home



Step by step , heart to heart , left right left
We all fall down


Step by step , heart to heart , left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit , torn apart , we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers


I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it , my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader , my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off , I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it , it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy , this shit went way beyond some Jay - z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won , I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it , honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip - hop for , it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions , my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'
And that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out , this just wasn't my beef
So I did , I just fell back , watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over tv down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it i understand this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause




There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated , it ain't just words no more is it
It's a different ball game , callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him , kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em , mash 'em and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it , that motherfucker can get it too , fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us , strictly to show they support us
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runyan Avenue , soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
It ain't worth it , I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted , it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man
If ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws , well then I can
Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause





I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America

And to the Republic for which it stands

One nation under God

Indivisible with liberty and justice for all

It feels so good to be back


I scrutinize every word , memorize every line

I spit it once , refuel , re - energize and rewind

I give sight to the blind , my insight through the mind

I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time

It's just all in your mind , what you interpret it as

I say to fight , you take it as I'mma whip someone's ass

If you don't understand , don't even bother to ask

A father who has grown up with a fatherless past

Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has

Or at least shows no difficulty multi - task

And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft

Slash entrepreneur who has helped launch a few more rap acts

Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half

Of his career typical manure moving past that

Mr kisses ass crack , he's a class act

Rubber band man , yea he just snaps back



Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness

As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed

Carry on , give me hope , give me strength

Come with me and I won't steer you wrong

Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog

To the light at the end of the tunnel

We gonna fight , we gonna charge , we gonna stomp , we gonna march

Through the swamp , we gonna mosh through the marsh

Take us right through the doors 


All the people up top on the side and the middle

Come together lets all bomb and swamp just a little

Just let it gradually build from the front to the back

All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black

Don't matter what color , all that matters we gathered together

To celebrate for the same cause don't matter the weather

If it rains let it rain , yea the wetter the better

They ain't gonna stop us they can't , we stronger now more than ever

They tell us no we say yea , they tell us stop we say go

Rebel with a rebel yell , raise hell we gonna let em know

Stomp , push , shove , mush , Fuck Bush , until they bring our troops home 




Imagine it pouring , it's raining down on us

Mosh pits outside the oval office

Someone's tryina tell us something ,

Maybe this is God just sayin' we're responsible

For this monster , this coward ,

That we have empowered

This is Bin Laden , look at his head noddin'

How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists

Now this is our final hour

Let me be the voice in your strength and your choice

Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise

Try to amplify the times it , and multiply by six

Teen million people , Are equal at this high pitch

Maybe we can reach alqueda through my speech

Let the president answer a higher anarchy

Strap him with an Ak - 47 , let him go , fight his own war

Let him impress daddy that way

No more blood for oil , we got our own battles to fight on our own soil

No more psychological warfare , to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal

If we don't serve our own country , we're patronizing a hero

Look in his eyes its all lies

The stars and stripes , they've been swiped , washed out and wiped

And replaced with his own face , Mosh now or die

If I get sniped tonight you know why ,

Cause I told you to fight




And as we proceed ,

To Mosh through this desert storm ,

In these closing statements , if they should argue

Let us beg to differ

As we set aside our differences

And assemble our own army

To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction

That we call our President , for the present

And Mosh for the future of our next generation

To speak and be heard

Mr President , Mr Senator

Do you guy's hear ushear us 




There I go -  - thinking of you again


You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you , I puke
You must just not know -  - whoa - whoa - whoa - whoa
You may not think you do , but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more , more suitable for this type of song -  - whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Sixteen bars , this ain't enough to put some ink ta
So fuck it , I'ma start right here I'll just be brief I'm
Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo of you
On my arm , but what do I go and do
I go and get another one , now I got two
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Now I'm sittin' here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend , now her name's gotta be Kim
Shi - ii - ii - ii - ii - ii - it
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfuckin' thing you ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you
Boo - oo - oo - oo - oo - oo - who


You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you , I puke
You must just not know -  - whoa - whoa - whoa - whoa
You may not think you do , but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter
That you'd probably just shred up -  - yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta , a stupid piece a
Paper , I'd rather let you see how
Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle
You're a fuckin' coke - head slut , I hope you fuckin' die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fuckin' guts , you fuckin' slut , I hope you die
Di - ii - ii - ii - ii - ii - ie
But please don't get me wrong , I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you , it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you , it makes me wanna
Gag - aa - aa - aa - aa - aa - aa - ag
What else can I do , I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on , I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do
Is pu - uu - uu - uu - uu - uu - uke


You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you , I puke
You must just not know -  - whoa - whoa - whoa - whoa
You may not think you do , but you do
Every time I think of you , I puke

Fuckin' bitch



Ohh

Yeah

So much for first single on this one



Shady's the label

Aftermath is the stable

That the horses come out erra

Of course we're about to stir up

Some shit thick as Mrs Buttersworth's syrup

It's the Mr picked on Christopher Reeves

Just for no reason other than the just to tease him

Cause he was was his biggest fan , he used to be Superman

Now we're pouring liquor on the curb in his name for him

Eminem you wait till' we meet up again

Fucker I'm kicking your ass for everything you've ever said

It's one for the money two for the fucking show

Ready get set , let's go

Here comes the bucking bronco stomping and stampeding up the damn street

Like them buffalo soldiers , I told ya I'm bout' to blow

So look out below , Geronimo , motherfuckers is dominos

I'm on a roll , around and around I go

When will I stop I don't know

Tryna pick up where the Eminem Show left off

But I know anything's possible

Though I'm not gonna top what I sold

I'm at the top of my game

That shit is not gonna change

Long as I got Dr Dre on my team

I'll get away with murder

I'm like OJ he's like my Cochran today

We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes

In a safe , locked them away

Better watch what you say

Just when you thought you were safe

Them fuckers got you on tape

You swear to god you was playing

Whether or not you was little Joshua

Gosh I wish I could've told you to not do the same

Cause one day it could cost you your name



And this was supposed to be my first single

But I just fucked that up so ,

Fuck it , let's all have fun let's mingle

Slap a bitch and smack a ho

This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle

To sneak in VIP to see R Kelly

Hehehehehe , to be so young and naive

Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and care free

Who keeps tilting the lens at an angle

Chicka Chicka

Just recently somebody just discovered

Britney and Justin videotapes of them fucking

When they were just musketeers in the Mickey Mouse club

And dusted them and went straight to The Source with them

Cause they could've sworn someone said Nuh - 

And then tried to erase and record over it

But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the

Ga - Uh and then the come to find out it was Justin

Saying I'm gonna come

And this was suppose to be

And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it

All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number

It's 1 - 800 - I'm a dick sucker I love to suck a dick

And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me

Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key

And I'll be sure to get back

As soon as there comes a day that I fall out with Dre

Wake up gay , make up with Ray 

So fuck a chicken , lick a chicken , suck a chicken ,

Beat a chicken , eat a chicken like it's a big cock bawka - bi - kaw

Or suck a dick , and lick a dick and eat a dick

And stick a dick in your mouth

You find me offensive , I find you offensive
For finding me offensive
Hence , if I should draw the line on any fences
If so to what extent
If at any should I go
'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this ,
Far at other peoples' expenses
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship
And it's down right blasphemous
Let's end this shit now 'cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman , I killed Super -  - man
And how ironic , that I'd be the bad guy
Kryptonite: The Green Chronic


'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain , nice to meet you
Hi , my name is
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
Rain Man

Now in the Bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed ,
Have homosexual sex
Unless , of course , you were given the consent to join in
Then , of course , it's intercourse
And it's bi - sexual sex
Which isn't as bad , as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before , during or after performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to have such , more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids
In a more derogatory way but
Who's to say , what's fair to say , and what not to say
Let's ask Dr Dre
Dr Dre 
I gotta question if I may 
Is it gay to play Putt - Putt golf with a friend 
And watch his butt - butt when he tees off 
But , up I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hutt - hutt
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped , fell , slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't mean to go in into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a females butt
Is that gay I just need to clear things up
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because



You find me offensive , I find you offensive
Shit , this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whip - ass canister
Goddamn it Dre where's the god damn beat 
Anyway , anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy , Kryptonite: The Green Chronic
Demonic , yep yep , don't worry I'm on it
I got it , high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and zoom
I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter , jelly , chicken , tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no god damn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit


Cause IIIAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHAHAHAAA AAAAAHAHHHHHHHHHH
Yo , Rain Man
Definitely , definitely Dr Dre super dope beat maker two thousand and
Two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
Nine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three
And seventy 



I don't understand

Why are you being so mean

You're mean mean man



You are just jealous of me

Cuz you , you just can't do what I do

So instead of just admitting it

You walk around and say

All kinds of really mean things

About me cuz you're a meanie , a meanie

But it's only cuz you're

Just really jealous of me

Cuz I'm what you want to be

So you just look like an idiot

When you say these mean things

Cuz it's too easy to see

You're really just a big weenie , big weenie



Alright listen , I need you to focus

I need you to go dig deep in your mind , this is important

We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts

I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment

Now I need you to open your mind - your eyes close them

You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis

For the next four and a half minutes

We are going to explore into your mind

To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous

Now why did they make Yoo - Hoo

Hippity ga - ga boo - boo

Psych , I'm kidding

I just wanted to see if you're still listenin'

Ok , now I need your undivided attention

Sir I have a question

Why do I always sense this undeniable tension

From the moment that I enter into the room

It gets all quiet and whispers

Whenever theres conversation , why am I always mentioned

I've been dying to ask , it's been itchin' at me

Is it just because





Alright now I , I just flubbed a line

I was going to say something extremely important

But I forgot who or what it was , I fucked up

Psych , I'm kidding again you idiot , no I didn't

That's just what you wanted to hear from me

Is that I fucked up ain't it

But I can bust one take without lookin' at no paper

It doesn't take a bunch of takes

Or me to stand here in this booth all day

For me to say the truth , ok

You're droolin , you have tooth decay

Your mouth is open , you're disgusting

What the fuck you eat for lunch

A bunch of sweets or something , what

You munch a bunch of Crunch 'N Munch

Your tooth is rotten to the gum

Your breath stinks , wanna chew some gum

Yes I do sir , what am I on

You sir are on truth syrum

Marshall I'm so jealous of you

Please say you won't tell nobody

I'd be so embarrassed , I'm just absolutely terrified

That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying

All these terrible , evil and awful mean things

It's my own insecurity





Alright now we , we're going to conduct

That experiment that we were talking about earlier

Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy

Cuz that's exactly what your eyes look like , want to check to see

Here's a mirror , notice the resemblence here

Wait , let me put these sun glasses on

Now look in this mirror , how about now

What do you have in common

You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em

You look like I sound like singing about weenies

Now take my weenie out of your mouth

This is between me and you , I know you're not happy

I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying

Curled up in a ball tweeked out of my mind dying

There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is

Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges

Why you even doing this to yourself , it's pointless

Why do we have to keep on going through this , this is tortuous

My point is this

That if you say mean things , weenie will shrink

Now I fogot what the chorus is , your just is






Down , down , down , down , down , down , down , down , down , down
OK
Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Whaaaaaaaa

Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor , to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright StopPajama time


Come here little kiddies , On my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap as in a new case of child molestation accusation

No worries , papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise
I done touched on everything , but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor , I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God , dip , do a little slide
Bend down , touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bunghole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know , who'd hear it
Give a little poot poot , it's OK 
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip


Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance

Well , it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday , I dunno what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway
Feelin' kinda breezy
Got the top down , lettin' my hair blow
I dunno where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there
Someone's gonna touch my body

Excuse me miss , I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me , maybe gouge my eyes out 
Now , what's your name girl
What's your sign
 Man , you must be up out your mind

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was running butt naked
Down the street screaming

Well I'm sorry , I don't remember
All I know is this much
I'm not guilty
They said , Save it , boy we gotcha you on tape
yellin' at an old lady to 'Touch my body'

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense , no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Snap back to reality
Look it's BRabbit
Yo you signed me up to battle

Chubba chubba chubba chubba chubba chubbie

The way you move it , you make my pee pee go

Doing , doing , doing


I don't believe it , it's almost too good to be true

I ain't never seen an ass like that

The way you move it , you make my pee pee go

Doing , doing , doing


The way she moves she's like a belly dancer

She's shaking that ass to that new nelly jam , I

Think someones at the door

But I don't think I'm gonna answer

Police saying freeze

And I can say that and you'll laugh cuz that is a puppet on my hand

Maybe next year I'll say ass and she'll make my pee pee go

I just baked cookies Mr Officer , looky , take a whiff of these

Here , I make Jesus juice , take a sip of this

Nobody is safe from me , no not even me

I don't even know if I can say the word pee pee , pee

On the radio , but I think I did

Janet , is that a breast , I think I just saw a tit

Psych , I joke , I joke , I kidd , I kidd

So Gwen Stefani , will you pee pee on me please

I ain't never seen an ass like that

Cuz the way you move it , you make my pee pee go

Doing , doing , doing


What the fuck is wrong with you 




If there's any bitches in this room , then there's something I gotta say

For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way

I've been down that road and now I'm back , sittin' on square one

Tryna pick myself up where I started from



I never woulda thought that I'd see you outta control

Even though my penis was deep down in your hole

You should know between us we was like mates to soul

Nothing could intervene us , especially no hoes

You was more so the chalant type , I chose

To more shows , haunted you nights I suppose

That's how it go , with time spent , emotion grows

In the beginning , friends we decided to roll

So who's responsible when you get excited , explode

And Obie's grinning , then you invite that Obie's cold

But bitches the gon' talk , niggas they gon' hate

We established this way before we became mates

So whats required is that you chill with all that fire

Get your desire when I retire



Spend some time with me , say that you'll be mine

I never thought I'd find someone to be mine

Lord knows I was right cuz you just crossed the line

Spend some time with me , say that you'll be mine



I used to say I never met a girl like you before

Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are

Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters

Till you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers

Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for

Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore

You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours

All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls

If you recall I used to treat you as a groupie broad

When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off

But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off

It was a shock , it struck me as odd but it turned me on

You started getting moody on me , pretty soon we'd argue

And the ruder you got , the more beautiful you got to me

And who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly

Cupid could shoot another one of them God damn darts at me

It's true that I got shot in the heart

But when someone seems too good to be true , they usually are

But see , when you're in it it's too hard to see

Till you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach

Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat

Before you make a decision that's life altering

And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave

You hear them words echoing , almost haunting , that taunting ring





In most cases , Stat's attitude is fuck - a - bitch

My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch

But you was different , thought we shared a covenant

Even held your hand in public , we sufferin' because of this

Shorty on some whole 'notha other shit

Tryna play sick thinkin' i'mma trick off rick

I'll admit , I was caught in the mix , down to commit

Feed you the best of me , I shoulda fed you piss

We started off closer than close

But who coulda predicted to know , your triflin' ways woulda stopped our growth

And the final result , back in that same boat

I ask myself , do I love these hoes NO



Em introduced us , 50 this is Tanya , Tanya this is 50

Then slid off and left her to kick it with me

I complimented her , I said you have very nice lips

With my imagination , I could see her suckin' my dick

We played the phone game , a week later , shit changed fast

Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass

Downtown Manhattan on the balcony , stare at the skyline

Penthouse full of imported shit , you know how I grind

She got to talkin' , talkin' like an opportunist too

Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move

Said she's an inspiring actress , she do videos for practice

Yeah , yeah , know how many times I done heard that shit





Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey , what daddy always tell you
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about
You got me

Hailie , I know you miss your mom , and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad , even when you smile , even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes , deep inside you want to cry
'Cause you're scared , I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying , wipe them tears
Daddy's here , no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it , we gon' do it
Lainie Uncle's crazy , ain't he
Yeah , but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins , when it swirls
When it whirls , when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled , in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move , mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that , the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up as daddy , that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way , your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries , rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream


Now hush little baby , don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up , little lady , I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy , pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright


It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum , see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mamma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work , you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV and momma didn't like it
And you and Lainnie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone , momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house , just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures , it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown , it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow , I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Lainnie I'm talkin' to you too , daddy's still here
I like the sound of that , yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it
Shh , mama's only gone for the moment



And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad 




I Tell myself that I'm doing alright

Nothing else to do tonight but

To go Crazy , Crazy On You

Lemme go Crazy , Crazy on you

youuuuuuuuu



Can't you see what you do to me baby

You make me crazy , you make me act like a maniac

I'm like a lunatic , you make me sick

You truly are the only one who can do this to me

You just make me get so crazy

I go skitzo , I get so insane I just go skitzophrenic

One minute I want to slit your throat

The next I want to sex

You make me crazy ,

the way we act like 2 maniacs in the sac

We fuck like 2 jackrabbits

And maybe that's a bad habit

Cuz the next day we're right back at it

In the same exact pattern

What the fuck is the matter with us

We can't figure out if it's

Lust or it's love

What's sad is what's attracting us to each other

They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother

Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch

But I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today

But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you

Just cuz I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you

But if there's one thing about you I admire its , baby ,

Because you stay with me , maybe , because you're as crazy as I am

Cuz when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes

But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side

Like a devil in disguise ,

You're always full of surprises

Always pullin' devises

Out your purse , little vibrators and dildos

You fucked yourself so much

You barely feel those anymore

You're only 24 but you're plenty more mature

Than those other little hoes

Who just act like little girls

Like they're in middle school still

You're crazy sexy cool , chillin

You play your position

You never step out of line

Even though I stay in your business

You've always kept out of mine

I wonder whats on your mind

Sometimes they say love is blind

Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye

You ain't see a sign



Or maybe you did Maybe you like being shoved

Maybe cuz we're crazy in loooove



Crazy on you

Crazy on you

Let me go crazy crazy on youuuuuuuuu




You're the ink to my paper

Where my pen is to my pad

The moral , the very fiber

The whole substance to my rap

You are my reason for being

The meaning of my existence

If it wasn't for you

I would never be able to spit this

As intense I do and the irony

Is you rely on me as much

as I rely on you to inspire me like you do

You provide me the lighter fluid to fuel my fire

You're my entire supply

Gas , the match , the igniter

The only way that I am able to stay so stable

Is you're the legs to my table

If you were to break I'd fall on my face

But I'm always going to make you feel

I don't need you as much as I really need you

So you don't use it to your advantage

But you're essential to me

You're the air I breathe

I believe if you ever leave me

I'd probably have no reason to be

You are the Kim to my Marshall

You're the Slim to my Shady

The Dre to my Eminem

The Elaina to my Hailey

You are the word I am looking for when

I'm trying to describe how I feel inside

And the right one just won't come to my mind

You're like the pillar that props me up

The beam that supports me

The bitch who never took half ,

The wife who never divorced me

You're like the root to my evil

You let my devil come out me

You let me beat the shit out you

Before you beat the shit out me




And no matter how much

Too much is never enough

Maybe cuz we're crazy in loooove



I'm crazy on you

Crazy on you

Let me go crazy crazy on youuuuuuuuu



I told ya'll motherfuckers I was coming back
What now nigga what now what
You's the projects nigga


One shot two shot three shots four shots
All I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops
Bodies drop , hit the floor ,
Music's off , party stops ,
Everybody hit the door ,
Somebody's licking shots off


Security's gone I'm dropped in the club
And I'm tryna run and get my motherfucking gun

Nigga fuck my wife I'm tryna run and save my motherfucking life
Oh shit , the shooter's comin'
Bitches hollering , niggas running
People shot all over the floor
And I'm tryna make it to the St Andrew's door
That's the sound of the glock
Even DJ House you fucked around and got shot
I done messed around and forgot my tec
I don't see nobody but Fab Five and Hex



These niggas is trippin'

I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wildin'
Two minutes ago we was all joking and smiling
This chick is clinging onto me sobbing and sighing
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she crying
But it's real and it's on and cats is getting killed
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
And she got hit now she yelling

I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my 38 I hope its not to late





I'm on seven mile what the fuck was that
Damn somebody hit me from the back

With a gat nigga and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole , them niggas some hoes

I don't know
But I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi with

Man 
And I was on my way there
Believe me I'm leaving a carcass today
And I'mma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut , my AK ain't even tucked
I'm gonna meet you at the club we're gonna fuck these hoes up




I've never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleeping outside the door waiting in line
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd fans
And some cum wad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off
Missed who he's aiming for six feet away's the door
Into the same entrance hall now the strays flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up by the bar having a Mazel Tov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
Thank god I'm alive I gotta find a nine
And where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not , what the fuck oh my god it was
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her
God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit
My vest is barely able to handle it , it's too thin
If I get hit again I can't do it , I scoop Dee
Follow Bizarre's path and ran through it
Made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Looked up and I seen Swift shooting it out
But I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him squeezing his four fifth




It's Friday night came to this bitch right
Big ass in my left hand , Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here so it's clear that this fucker
Shoot out the back of his truck goes up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money two's to stop the show
Third's for the bartender there's plenty of shots to go

He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee with a three piece






Sh - sh - sh - shady

Aftermath , haha

G - G - G - G - G - Unit , haha



Cause we came here to set this party off right

Let's bounce tonight

And if they don't let us in through the front

We'll come through the side

Cuz i don't ever wanna leave the game without

At least saying goodbye

So all my people on the left , all my people on the right

Swing one last time



Get your ass up for the doctor

One more time , get your ass up for the doctor

Come on now , here we go

Cliff hanger , it's another club banger

Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat

Get on down



Times up , games over , you lose , I win

'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here

Ooh yeah , new year , next phase , begin

Look who's got you goin' crazy again

I'm a trend , I set one every time I'm in

I go out and just come back full circle again

You a fad , that means your something that we already had

But once you're gone , you don't come back , too bad



You're off the map now , radar can't even find you

We stay on the grind , you slip , we out - grind you

You walk around mad , you let your anger blind you

We walk around just playin' the violin behind you

Enough with all the pissin' and moanin' , whinin' and bitchin'

Sit and observe , listen , you'll learn if you pay attention

Why ten multi - platinum albums later , three diamond

World - wide , we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'





When dr dre say crunk , you will get it crunk , get it crunk

Crunk , crunk , crunk

And when 50 cent says jump , you get on one foot and jump

Jump , jump , jump , jump



The buzz is tremendous , we drop you all to sense it

I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches



We keep the party rockin' off the henges

We ain't showin' off , we just goin' off popular consensus



But critics say that Doc is soft , Doc is talk

Doc is all washed up , knock it off

Who the fuck is Doc impressin'

Doc is this , Doc is that , you got the wrong impression

You must be on the cock of Doc , cuz Doc left you all guessin'

So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record 

We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second 

That's why we always save the best cut last

To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass



Cuz we done swam with the sharks , wrestle with alligators

Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers

Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap

Maybe raised to be racist

Who may have never got to see our faces

Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages

Broke down barriers of language and races

Just call on the cape crusaders

And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic

And we can play the back and forth all day

Like the hot potato game , thats why we came to





50 cent , come on



Bounce now , hands up , you know how we do

We make the club jump everywhere we go

It's no secret , everybody know

When Dre's involved , there's plenty money involved



And plenty honey's involved , the sunny Sunday's and palm trees

Cali , everyday it's just another party from the valley's

All the way to them 8 Mile alleys , let's rally



Hands up for the grand finale

Now raise up out your seat , Dre is about to speak

Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week



You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to

Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker



So never say never cuz Shady Aftermath together

Along with G - Unit Records presents the return of the - the Doc 

No one could do it better

We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh





Yeah , haha

Still Aftermath , 2006

And don't worry about that Detox album

It's comin' , we gonna make Dre do it , haha

50 cent , G - unit , Obie Trice , D - twizzy , Stat Quo , Dr Dre

We ain't leavin' , let's go haha

Ladies and gentlemen , thank you all for comin' out , peace

Oh shit , I almost forgot

You're comin' with me 

Haha , bye bye

See you in hell , fuckers




There's an intruder
in my house
He cut my phone - lines
can't dial out
I scream for police
but I doubt
They're gonna hear me
when I shout



A couple of cocktails will send me to jail
there's a couple of cops hot on my trail
But this time , when I get pulled over
there's a doberman pincher and a pitbull in the seat
these pigs 'll get bit fooling with me
quit fooling with me
Bitch , you're gonna see
No pistol in the seat
why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
and which you're gonna see in the long run
Im'a be the wrong one
you wanna harass with this limo tinted glass
flashing that flash - light on my ass where was you at
last night when them assholes
ran up on my grass
rapper slash actor
kiss the crack on my cracker slashed ass
they took away my right to bear arms
what I'm 'posed to fight with bare palms
yeah right
they coming with bombs , I'm coming with flare - guns
We as Americans



We as a Americans
Us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves
Look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves
Living up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Surviving by any means

And we are Americans

Im'a make buku bucks
wearing buku vests
Drama hanging over my head like a voodoo hex
I could've been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
but you know who
with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed
Now I got the Industry pissy
ever since me and Dre split it fifty - fifty on fifty it's funny
We got a buzz spreading quicker than making paper - airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the president dead
It's never been said
but I set precedents and the standards
and they can't stand it
My name should've been bastard
the shit should've been plastered
on my forehead with a stamp
I should've been blasted
I should've been had a cap pulled in my ass
but I'm too swift and fast
for that , I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot
Fuck that shit
I done seen how fast this rap shit
can turn into some pap - pap shit
that quick
snap click
but this time they got fucking auto - ma - tic
 and no one gon' test this mon
Clack

I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two Nina's under my jeans either side of my penis
under my Long Johns
under my Sean Johns
when running with the long arm of the law I'm long gone
Im'a do five years no less than that
no questions asked
it might be a good idea to stop right here
and quit while I'm ahead
already in the red
already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back
bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass
he probably gone send a task
I ain't gone even ask
they ain't gone let me pack
they ain't gone gimme my semi but I got my Whizz at

You still love me

Take this 

You ready 1 2 3 



The more you , put me through ,

The more it makes me wanna come back to you ,

You say you hate me , I just love you more ,

You don't want me , I just want you more ,

I buy you flowers , you throw 'em at me ,

I know it's sad but it's making me happy ,

The more that you slap me , the more that it turns me on ,

Cause you love me , and I love you more



It's sick , but who could ever predict ,

We'd be doin' the same shit ,

We say we do it for our baby but we don't ,

We do it for us , it's lust ,

Cause neither one of us trusts each other ,

So we fuck 'til we bust ,

Then we cuss each other , out ,

We know what it's about ,

Shout 'til I throw you out the house ,

You throw me out the house ,

I throw you on the couch ,

Punch you in the mouth ,

Fist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT ,

And apologize after ,

Laughter , pain , it's insane ,

We're back in the same chapter again ,

And it's sad but it's true ,

When I'm layin' here with you ,

There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do





Cause I hate you , do you hate me

Good cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry ,

It makes me wanna just take you ,

And just throw you on the bed ,

And fuck you like I don't even know you ,

You fuck other people , and I fuck other people ,

You a slut but I'm equal , I'm a mutt ,

We're both evil in our ways ,

But neither one of us would ever admit it ,

Cause one of us would have one up on the other ,

So forget it ,

We can make accusations , people spread rumors ,

But they ain't got proof ,

'Til they do it's just the two of us ,

It's you and me , cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me ,

But you gotta believe me to a degree ,

Cause true indeed if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it ,

Yeah I would cause the sex is too damn good ,

If I ran who would I run to ,

That would be this soft and warm ,

So it's off and on , usually more off than on ,

But at least we know that we share this common bond ,

You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on ,

I hope , the only reason that I cope ,

Is cause of that fact ,

And plus I can bust in that ,

And that's why





I could never understand it ,

That's why I don't try ,

From junior high until we both die ,

It's silly ho why must we try ,

Is it really so rough ,

That we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff ,

Try to pull each other's legs ,

Until the other begs ,

We're liein' to ourselves ,

That's the beauty of it yeah ,

Cause we truly love each other ,

That's why we always fight ,

And all we do is shove each other ,

Every other fuckin' night ,

And it's clear it ain't gonna change ,

It's pent up rage ,

We both have ,

We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else ,

We've both been ,

Someone else's someone else ,

Problem is neither one wants help ,

It's an addiction and it can't be fixed ,

Our family's mixed up ,

There's a baby sister in the mix ,

And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit ,

And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit ,

And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time ,

On every song , every lyric , and every rhyme ,

All the hoopla , all of the whoopdy whoop ,

What you put me through , fuckin' whoopdy doo ,

But I won't be made a fool of ,

If this is true love ,

You wouldn't do what ,

You did last time ,

You wouldn't screw up ,

This time ,

Cause this time girl ,

I'm telling you what ,

You do it again I'm fucking you up ,

No matter what



What you say , what you do ,

I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you ,

No matter where you run , I'll be right there ,

Right behind you , in your nightmares ,

All the flowers , and the candy ,

All the times that you threw it back at me ,

You told me you hate me , you're gonna hate me more ,

When you find out , can't escape me whore






WHOOOO

Hey , how you guys doin

You want more

Alright , then SHUT UP


Shoobeedoo 

Shoobeedoo 

Shoobeedoo 

Shoobeedoo Shoobee Snoobedeebeebop


Girl

Whatever
Dre , just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo this song is for anyone fuck it
Just shut up and listen , aiyyo

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this  -  on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensing these sentences
Getting this stress that's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully 
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone , when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
Do not come and speak to me 
I don't know you and no ,
I don't owe you a motherfucking thing
I'm not Mr N'Sync , I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr Friendly , I can be a prick
If you tick me my tank is on empty 
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm lifting you 10 feet  in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer , file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you 
I don't mean to be mean , but that's all I can be is just me


And I am , whatever you say I am
If I wasn't , then why would I say I am
In the paper , the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am , whatever you say I am
If I wasn't , then why would I say I am
In the paper , the news everyday I am
I don't know , it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father ,
I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense it's constant
And , Oh , it's his lyrical content  - 
 -  the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me 
So I point one back at 'em , but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb , it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck , when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull , 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn  and the heroin
Where were the parents at And look where it's at
Middle America , now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see , an upper class city
Having this happening 
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way 
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burning and I have returned


And I am , whatever you say I am
If I wasn't , then why would I say I am
In the paper , the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am , whatever you say I am
If I wasn't , then why would I say I am
In the paper , the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label , let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on My Name is 
And pigeon - holed into some pop - py sensation
That got me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience 
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent , and grab on my balls , so they always keep asking
The same fucking questions 
What school did I go to , what hood I grew up in
The why , the who what when , the where , and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out
'Cause they driving me crazy  I can't take it
I'm racing , I'm pacing , I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit , in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No , I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad


'Cause I am , whatever you say I am
If I wasn't , then why would I say I am
In the paper , the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am , whatever you say I am
If I wasn't , then why would I say I am
In the paper , the news everyday I am
I don't know , it's just the way I am



Hi My name is  My name is 
My name is  Slim Shady
Hi My name is  My name is 
My name is  Slim Shady

Ahem excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class for one second


Hi kids Do you like violence 
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids 
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did 
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is 
My brain's dead weight , I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate 
And Dr Dre said , Slim Shady you a basehead
Uh - uhhh So why's your face red Man you wasted
Well since age twelve , I've felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut 
I don't give a fuck , God sent me to piss the world off




My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot , next semester I'll be thirty - five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser , chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers 
Walked in the strip club , had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender , then stuck my dick in her tip cup
Extraterrestrial runnin' over pedestrians
In a space ship while they screaming at me: LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS
Ninety - nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do 
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her 
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans 
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph

So I signed it: 'Dear Dave , thanks for the support , ASSHOLE'




Stop the tape This kid needs to be locked away 
Dr Dre , don't just stand there , OPERATE
I'm not ready to leave , it's too scary to die 
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive 
Am I coming or going I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka  -  dare me to drive 
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years , and my palms are too hairy to hide 
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk 
I spit when I talk , I'll fuck anything that walks 
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me mom 
You ain't got no tits 
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head 
I'm steaming mad 
And by the way when you see my dad 
Tell him that I slit his throat , in this dream I had





Look , if you had , one shot , or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted In one moment
Would you capture it , or just let it slip
Yo

His palms are sweaty , knees weak , arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already , mom's spaghetti
He's nervous , but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs ,
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down ,
The whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth , but the words won't come out
He's choking how , everybody's joking now
The clock's run out , time's up , over , blaow
Snap back to reality Oh , there goes gravity
Oh , there goes Rabbit , he choked
He's so mad , but he won't give up that
Easy , no
He won't have it , he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter , he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so sad that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home , that's when it's
Back to the lab again , yo
This whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him


You better lose yourself in the music , the moment
You own it , you better never let it go 
You only get one shot , do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
You better lose yourself in the music , the moment
You own it , you better never let it go 
You only get one shot , do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 


The soul's escaping , through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king , as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring , but superstardom's close to postmortem
It only grows harder , homie grows hotter
He blows It's all over These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows , he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads , God only knows
He's grown farther from home , he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no more , he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner , but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da da da



No more games , I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning , the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man , these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie , there's no Mekhi Phifer , this is my life
And these times are so hard , and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed , plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a primadonna
Baby , mama drama's screaming on her
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot , another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point , I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option , failure's not
Mom , I love you , but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet , fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got



You can do anything you set your mind to , man



Shady , Aftermath

There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control


Get buzzed , get drunk , get crunked , get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked , get sucked , get wasted , shit faceted
Pasted , blasted , puke drink up , get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink , throw up
Wipe your shoe clean , got a routine
Knowing still got a few chunks on your shoestring
Showing I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this Bitch gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit


Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfucking mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk , seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie


We 'bout to have a party 
Let's get it started 
I'm looking for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it popping baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm looking for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say every day she be giving it up


Shake that ass for me , shake that ass for me
Come on girl , shake that ass for me , shake that ass for me
Oh girl , shake that ass for me , shake that ass for me
Come on girl , shake that ass for me , shake that ass for me


I'm a menace , a dentist , an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rinse
Swish but don't spit it , swallow when I finish
Yeah me and Nate d - o double g
Looking for a couple bitches with some double d's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly , we finna finna have a party


Have a party 
Let's get it started 
I'm looking for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big Ol' butt
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me , sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut , would you be mine
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine


Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut , hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind


Shake that ass for me , shake that ass for me
C'mon girl , shake that ass for me , shake that ass for me
Oh girl , shake that ass for me , shake that ass for me
C'mon girl , shake that ass for me , shake that ass for me
We 'bout to have a party 
Let's get it started 
I'm looking for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm looking for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say every day she be giving it up


There she goes , shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin and grinding that pole
The way she's grinding that pole
I think I'm losing control

God , come on



I ain't leavin' without you bitch

Coming home with me

And my boy , and his boy , and his boy , and his girl

Ha ha , Nate Dogg




 
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing , it's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone , cold and he don't care
He's a problem child
What bothers him all comes out , when he talks about
His fuckin' dad walkin' out
'Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked , he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black , brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants , do - rags and a stocking cap
His step - father hit him , so he socked him back , and broke his nose
His house is a broken home , there's no control , he just let's his emotions go


 , sing with me ,  , sing for the years
 , sing for the laughter , sing for the tears , 
Sing it with me , just for today , maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away


Entertainment is changin' , intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers , a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy , only have one homie
Only this gun , lonely 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate , I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
Or they can degrade , or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us , plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune , no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you , journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you , attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have , they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me , strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously , so I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace , this shit doesn't make sense Pete
It's all political , if my music is literal , and I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldn't , I wouldn't be fit to , you're full of shit too , Guerrera , that was a fist that hit you




They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you  , and cock it too
Well if it can , then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves , we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales , you ignoramus
But music is reflection of self , we just explain it , and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it
How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids , who don't have a thing
Except for a dream , and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin - up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit , and they vibe
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it , squeeze it and hold it
'Cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on , through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can





Obie Trice/Real Name No Gimmicks


two trailer park girls go 'round the outside , 'round the outside , 'round the outside

Guess who's back , back again
Shady's back , tell a friend
Guess who's back ,
guess who's back ,
guess who's back ,
guess who's back
guess who's back
Guess who's back


I've created a monster , 'cause nobody wants to
see Marshall no more they want Shady I'm chopped liver
well if you want Shady , this is what I'll give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka that'll jumpstart my heart quicker than a
shock when I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor when I'm not cooperating
when I'm rocking the table while he's operating 
you waited this long now stop debating 'cause I'm back ,
I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms Cheney but your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
they tried to shut me down on MTV but it feels so empty without me
So come on dip , bum on your lips fuck that ,
cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits Fuck
YOU DEBBIE


Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy ,
'Cause it feels so empty without me


Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed , their parents still listen to Elvis
they start feeling like prisoners , helpless ,
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch
A visionary , vision is scary , could start a revolution , polluting the air waves a rebel
so just let me revel and bask , in the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
and it's a disaster such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well I'm back 
fix your bent antennae tune it in and then I'm gonna
enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting , the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing Attention Please feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
A nuisance , who sent , you sent for me




A tisk - it a task - it , I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit , that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards , and Moby
you can get stomped by Obie , you 36 year old bald headed fag blow me
You don't know me , you're too old let go it's over , nobody listens to techno
Now let's go , just give me the signal I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope , suspenseful with a pencil ever since
Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems , everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting , but it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley , to do Black Music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy 
there's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea it'd be so empty without me



 
Kids



Yeah
It's my life
My own words I guess


Have you ever loved someone so much , you'd give an arm for
Not the expression , no , literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma , turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for , turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of her pain
Daddy look what I made , Dad's gotta go catch a plane
Daddy where's Mommy I can't find Mommy where is she
I don't know go play Hailie , baby , your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song , this song ain't goin' write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother , who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady , yeah baby , Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me , but tonight Shady's rocka - by - baby


And when I'm gone , just carry on , don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing , So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone , just carry on , don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing , So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back


I keep having this dream , I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming , she don't want me to sing
You're making Mommy cry , why Why is Mommy crying
Baby , Daddy ain't leaving no more , Daddy you're lying
You always say that , you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more , Daddy you're mine
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
Daddy please , Daddy don't leave , Daddy  -  no stop it
Goes in her pocket , pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture , This'll keep you safe Daddy , take it witcha
I look up , it's just me standing in the mirror
These fucking walls must be talking , cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying You've got one more chance to do right  -  and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage , they're gone , and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing


And when I'm gone , just carry on , don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing , So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone , just carry on , don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing , So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back


Sixty thousand people , all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes , they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud , I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down , I don't believe what I'm seeing
Daddy it's me , Help Mommy , her wrists are bleeding
But baby we're in Sweden , how did you get to Sweden
I followed you Daddy , you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me Dad , and now you make Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin , it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted , I just want to give you this coin
I get the point  -  fine , me and Mommy are going
But baby wait , it's too late Dad , you made your choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want , they want you Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep , just take another pill
Yeah , I bet you you will You rap about it , yeah , word , k - keep it real
I hear applause , all this time I couldn't see
How could it be , that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around , find a gun on the ground , cock it
Put it to my brain , scream Die Shady and pop it
The sky darkens , my life flashes , the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up , alarm clock's ringin' , there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging , I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her , Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say


And when I'm gone , just carry on , don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing , So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone , just carry on , don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing , So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back





I'll sit on you
Da da , da da , da da


I'll sit on you
I will sit on you
I'll sit on you
Girl you know it's true
I'll sit on you
Bitch or man
I'll sit on you
I will sit on you


I remain fatter than gluttony
Taping bombs to the back of record companies
Blow them up if they ain't want me
The National Guard , they scared to hunt me
I love beef; I got you hoes duckin me
A drug thief , bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs with keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggas in hundred degree saunas
You can act a fool if you wanna 
It's this lyrical piranha
Strapped with a grenade , in the pool with your mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nothin up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see them , you hoes ending up in a fuckin mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM
Pull in the garage while you screamin
Keep the motor on then I'm leaving 
I'll shit on you


I will bajs on you I don't care who you are

I don't give a fuck about you or your car

Fuck your house , fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch

Fuck your wife , fuck your kids , fuck your family



I'm a alcoholic with the fucking toilet
Pass the hot dogs 
Bitch shut your fucking mouth
I'm a keep eating 'till Richard Simmons comes to my house
With a chain saw to cut me out
My fuckin' wife
I haven't had sex since I met her
I'm to busy fucking , your 12 year old baby sitter
And all women ain't shit
Only good for cooking , cleaning
And sucking dick and that's it 
I was responsible for killing John Candy
I got Jonbenet Ramsey in my Ninety Eight Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody
Truly yours the idiotic Bizarre


My adolescent years weren't shit 'till what I do now
I never grew up I was born grown , and grew down
The older I get , the dumber the shit , I get in
The more ignorant , the incident , is I fit in
Ignoring the shit how boring it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwing a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
It's they who raised me and say the can take me
It's they who legs I brake and make achy
It's they who mistake me and make me so angry
 I'll spit on you
Start pissing and do the opposite on you
You weren't listening , I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon blew and
Straight shit like Notorious BIG did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Pull my pants down and




Is Richard Pryor still alive
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dying 
Born brainless , this steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel God dang - it
Bitch bring it , these niggas that I hang with
Will hang you up naked by your ankles dangling
My need I stay strangling
I don't need your help
If you gon' give me the pussy
I'll un - loosen my belt 
I'll punch your daddy not , your mom's kinda cock
Your sister tends court , your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck , I'll beat you with it across your chest


It's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun , when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat your peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in chokeholds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep

I see hoes biting , y'all don't wanna brawl
That's like D - Bo fightin Peablo Bryson 
So what you hollering and yelling about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fucking skeleton out
Niggas get hit with a two piece , Bling Bling
With a poisonous sting
I'm such a violent thing




Once I get on two , hits of X
My disk slips and disconnects
'Till I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects

Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters , five criminals pulling heaters
And spilling liters of blood like swimming pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too 
A lot of people say misoginistic which is true
I can't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy girl dog woman man child
I'll Shit On You

I will sit On You I don't care who you are



Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish , I only talk about jewels
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it
See , I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothing , I made something doing
What I do , through and through and I gave you the news with a twist it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade you been afraid
I penetrate pop culture , bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they
pop toasters , and they live with their mums
Got dropped roasters , from botched robberies niggas crotched over
Mummy's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No , he's not around now how that sound to ya , jot it down
I'll bring you through the ghetto without riding round
hiding down ducking strays from frustrated youths stuck in their ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothing relate to it
I help them see they way through it , not you
Can't step in my pants , can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt


Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it within a minute
Cause see , they call me a menace and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't , then ya'll swallow the truth grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title , put the youth in hysterics
Using his music to steer it sharing his views and his merits
But there's a huge interference , they're saying , You shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew , maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated , disputed , hated and viewed in America
as a motherfucking drug addict like you didn't experiment
Now now , that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again , and you get embarrassed
And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fucking do - gooders  -  too bad you couldn't DO - GOOD at marriage
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
Cause here we go , he's {Jigga durra Jigga da chk Jigga}
And I'm the sinister , Mr Kiss - My - Ass it's just the



RENEGADE Never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at , any given time of day
Cause I'm a RENEGADE Never been afraid to talk
about anything  anything  , RENEGADE


Never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at , any given time of day
Cause I'm a  Never been afraid to holler
about anything  anything 


I had to hustle , my back to the wall , ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lot of lint , not a cent
Gotta vent , lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench
What you hollering Gotta pay rent , bring dollars in
By the bodega , iron under my coat , feeling braver
Doo - rag wrapping my waves up , pockets full of hope
Do not step to me I'm awkward , I box leftier often
My pops left me and often my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me I wasn't growing , especially on nights
I brought something home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much , only raisin greener
Raising my fingers to critics , raising my head to the sky
Big I did it multi before I die 
No lie , just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight


See , I'm a poet to some , a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate , Satan and scatter - brained atheist
But that ain't the case , see , it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the ladder , a gateway to escape
Media scapegoat , they can be mad at today
See , it's as easy as cake , simple as whistling Dixie
while I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons , take a bath with the Catholics
in holy water no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfucking spiteful , delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube , motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do  I'm just a kid from the gutter
making his butter off these bloodsuckers , cause I'm a motherfucking

Shady , we're back




Nothin' can stop and nothin' can change it

you better just make new living arrangements ,

if you think your the top and king of the castle

You about to get thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole

All I hear is , I'm best at this an I'm best at that ,

but I don't hear my name No man brought up in rap

and I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that

but when they say one of the best , I'm nowhere thought of as that

Not even the same league as Jay - Z

Nas , Pac , Biggie or maybe they'll name me

Somewhere down at the bottom right after AZ

or say he ripped that Biggie verse or that Jay - Z

Yo , his verses were crazy on that Renegade beat

but I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady

And I all I hear is pop tunes come on the rad - i - o

And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily

And that very well may be the same reason they don't say me

when they speak on hip - hop legends which has amazed me

Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream

and make it big - big - big - big - b - baby




So maybe the 80's made me crazy , I been tryin' to get my weight

up since the A Slim Shady gave me the gate key , paid the ways

So lately mind state's get better each day , replay my relay race

when I was chasin' the a fey at 18 , 8 years later his voice in Beijing

no choice I chase cream so




Shady , we're back




This is what I eat , sleep , breath an feed my kids whatever I feel my family needs

I treat the mic like the block , fought with my rocks an squeeze critics who expect me to under achieve

I just deal with the hate I receive , I rollin' back my sleeves ,  show other bree with bran wrapped to

his knees

An tell him suck my dick , take a bow an leave with a sack full of amar cheese , I found it hard to believe

Who the bullet perceive to be G's an claim there runnin' shit , nigga I run me

An as a kid , teacher said I had a mouth on me , that same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E

Folk in the hood asking where I be , dawg I'm out in Hawaii , don't like it drink my pee

Record songs for the Detox LP , feet don't fail heat , niggas got me bent like cranberry and bellvee

I'm gonna die wealthy , boss of the game , what the fuck they goin' tell me , A - Town's own tre , Aftermath Shady




Shady , we're back




Y'all market y'all own block , they see me  that , rap game's an old flame my nigga I want 'em back

Like mic check , pimp for what it's worth I got the right knit , sittin' here excited by some shit that

ain't right yet

No regret , live by a cold June , no bot , y'all niggas won't be satisfied 'till I show  , go out on the

limb with Em 'cause I'm with him , put a barrel to they apparel to you an some of them

Stand a chance at the dance without a bowtie , Shady Records re - introduced you niggas to multi , so

hot , all the light that they given me an the haters like a chauffer because it's have driven me

To a view with a vendetta , I am the epitome , I don't give a fuck about you nigga I'm just livin' me

We the reason for the season so I'm just breezin' through the track , nigga




Shady




I can prove I'm here to do somethin' you never do , from hand to hand coke sales for my revenue

I ain't been to a bucks an why I ain't snuck a weapon through , there's no

background reveals a 1 - 8 - 7 - 2 , 'till the block I'm the truth , to the cops I'm the proof

And if a nigga's still out there you just gotta shoot , I carry over my street ethics to the booth

In the Shady crime fam , Al Capone in his youth , the difference between me an you , I already done an

lived the street life , niggas run away from it , you follow my life , in the Midwest blunted , pitchfork's

held high , 4 5th by the stomach , you find me right now on the CA streets , I'm on the roof of the

building shootin' at police , some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me , I'm gonna walkin' obituary ,

death live in me , I take life through the pen by the way I'm see I'll have you raped in the pen , like

American meat

I'm connected gettin' weight , from MS - 13 with SK's , AR's an Mini - 14's , I'm Ca$his , the last of

the real , were strapped on Prozac B's and E pills , it's the rap , got the block on tip , 2  of crack

Boom boom chuck , boom b - boom chuck

Boom boom chuck , b - boom , Shady




There's never been this , much of a menace in this game as this

And it's the , most sinister duo in the business

Once again its the , illest and realest killas

The most villainous Dre protege , Shady apprentice

Drop them zeros and get with these heroes

Do you want losers or winners , this music is in us , and it's

Not over 'till we say it's finished and G - Unit spinners

Will keep spinnin' , this is Hip Hop when it's in it's

Truest form , the greatest , Hate us or love us

Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' those pins in us

Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is

The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is

And as sick as his music is , or was , still is

Whatever , forever , he will be the illest

To ever sh - shock the world , what to do next

He's already reconciled with his ex  , a chainsaw and an axe

Jump a bitch's desk , strangle her neck

While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax

I sprays the vex , yeah bring Shady on back

The maniac of rap , devil baby on crack

Resurrect , I never left , baby I'm bad

I've gone mad , my comrade Dre - zy automatically

He says I'm too broke to fix , way beyond that

I may be off drugs , but it's made me off track

In fact , this right here very well could be the last rap

I ever do spit , I'll never do shit , that's that

Fuck it I quit , suck on a dick , jackass

I'm done with this wack ass rap , kiss my black ass




Nah , Em , tell 'em to kiss my black ass , to clean parts , to shitty parts ,

My bullet wounds , my beauty marks , the Fif'll tell you're ass apart

A game in this game , crush a motherfuckers free start ,

Different day , nothing change , it's the same shit , trick ,

Teflon wrapped on , case I get clapped on ,

D's searching the whip , glad I left the mac home ,

Still grindin' , still shinin' , nigga lord knows ,

You rocking wit the kid to spit sicker sick flows ,

I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it ,

Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it ,

E'eryday Dre day , front and cause a maylay ,

Turn the town upside down with a frown upside down ,

I smile through summan' fowl , and watch my money pile ,

This bottle of wine goes upside your head

A little bit psycho , but I know that

Think you just don't say it , then I won't say it

See if you don't brag , then I don't brag

I know I'm bad , as long as I know I'm bad

I don't need y'all to co - sign no shit

You can just keep making them tired old threats

A little bit like the boy you cried wolf yeah

See me , but don't dare to try no shit

Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers

A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass

And I can be so quiet and strike so fast

They wanna talk shit , let em talk shit , cause they talk shit

Knowing deep down , they really just wanna squash it

Cause no one wants to walk around , stepping in dog shit

My life is trapped in these lines ,

Thats why I'm packing these nines ,

I got a rap i ain't diein' ,

Thats in the back of my mind ,

Got a strap made of iron ,

Cant relax on this grind ,

Bending over backwards for these slackers

Til I'm snapping my spine ,

Natural highi gotta focus ,

On these bogus pochers ,

Looking over my shoulder ,

Proof get it poppin like show'd a hold up ,



WE NOTHING BUT SOLDIERS

Yes suh' , ya texta' is bitch

Bet'chya ya flinch when proof shoot up they crew

And wet ya whole clique



In my mind I'm a fighter , my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid , my flow sparks it right up
Arsenic writer , author with arthritis
Carpel tunnel , Marshall will start shit - itis
Hard headed and hot headed , bull headed and pig headed ,
Dick headed , a prick , a big headache I'm sick
Quick witted , for every lyric spitted there are 6 critics
Who wait for me to slip with it so quick
This dynamite stick buried the wick , it's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it and it's not Nelly
Do not tell me to stop yelling , when I stop selling I quit
So stop dwelling and I am not failing
You fuckers are not ready , 'cause I got jelly like  pot belly
This is Destiny , yes money I'm off running
So get off of me , I'm not slowing or softening


No apologies , nah suckers I'm not sorry
You can all sue me , y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies , y'all feelin' the force of me
No remorse for me , like there was no recourse for me
No apologies , not even acknowledging you at all
'til I get a call that god's coming
No apologies , laugh fuckers it's all funny
I can spit in ya face while your standin' across from me , no apologies


My head hits the pillow , a weeping willow , I can't sleep , a pain so deep it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow , hand's on my head , touched knees to elbow
I'm hunched over , emotion just flows over , these cold shoulders are both frozen , you don't know me
I keep saying it , I can't stress it enough , so keep playing it and stand next to the subs
I choke mic's like asphyxiation when I'm stranglin' my own throat masturbatin'
Fuck yeah I'm a basket case and I mastered this rap shit , 'til my ass gets wasted , 'til my assassination ,
'Til I'm slain 'cause of some fag's infatuation
44 mags a fascination , a taste for disaster and if that's the case then




This song isn't for you , it's for me , a true MC
It's what it do just to see if he still has it
And if his skills mastered ,
He's able to spill raps long after his killed , that's a real MC
Got you feelin' me , whether willing or unwillingly
You still agree , as long as there's still this hunger and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast if I ain't have this outlet to salvage me inside
I'd be exploding soaked in self loathing an mourning
So I'm warning you , don't coax me
It's silly , I'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed , don't be fooled
The press blows up this whole thing , it's stupid
They don't know 'cause they don't see that I'm wounded
All they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talkin' 'bout these tattoos cartoon did
That's why I tuned it out , I'm sick of dukin'
And they can suck my dick while I'm pukin' , and you too , you can


Expect no sympathy from me I'm an MC
This is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G , my hearts frozen it don't even beat
So expect no apologies



Oh oh oh oh oh ooh

There is no escaping
There's no place to hide
You scream , Someone save me
But they don't pay no mind
Goodbye

You're walkin' down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the morning and you're in a
Nightmare , it's horrible
Right there's the coroner
Waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya
You're a goner he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea he just saw you run
All you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep , thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowing a klonopin while I'm nodding in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada inn , holdin' on to the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom and make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me , Dead bodies behind the counter , shit
Guess I must have just blacked out again
Not again

It's 3 AM in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed em 
I said
It's 3 AM in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed em 

Sitting nude in my living room , it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube , maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfin' every channel until I find Hannah Montana
Then I reach for the Aloe and lanolin
Bust all over the wall paneling dismantlin' every candle
On top of the fireplace mantle and
Grab my flannel and my bandana then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to usin' hallucinogens
Causin' illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruisin' the skin
Razors , scissors and pins
Jesus , when does it end
Phases , that I go through
Days that I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who
Gave , these molecules to
Me , what am I gon' do
Hey the prodigal son
The diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter them

It's 3 AM in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed em 
I said
It's 3 AM in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed em 

She puts the lotion in the bucket , it puts the lotion on the skin , or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket , it puts the lotion on the skin , or else it gets the hose again

I cut and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun of a half pint of a jack
My last Vic and a half
A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December I think it was , I was havin' drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights , pushed him into the stinkin' tub
Cut him up into pieces and just when I went to drink his blood
I thought I oughta drink his bath water that oughta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me , that might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 AM and here I come so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here man there's got to be one
Oh no there's probably none , he can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs , but ain't no stoppin' me from choppin' him up up
'Cause it's

3 AM in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed em 
I said
It's 3 AM in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed em 



Yo yo , alright , i'm gonna lay the chorus first
Here we go now

My mom loved valium and lots of drugs
And that's why I am like I am cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
That's why I on what I on cause I'm my mom

My mom my mom I know you're probably tired of hearing about my mom Oh ho Whoa ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty and how I became hooked on va - al - ya - hum
Valium was in everything food that I ate , The water that I drank fucking peas on my plate ,
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak , So everyday I have at least three stomach aches ,
Now tell me what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an under a undera - fuckin - chiever , My teacher didn't think I was going be nothing either ,
What the fuck you sticking gum up under the fucking seat for
Mrs Mathers your son has been huffing ether , Either that or the mother fuckers been puffing reefer ,
But all this huffing and puffing wasn't what it was either ,
It was neither I was buzzing but it wasn't what she thought , Pee in a tea cup
Bitch you aint my keeper , i'm sleeping , What the fuck you keep on fucking with me for
Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone I aint playing ,
Go find you a white crayon and color a fucking zebra

My mom love Valium and lots of drugs , That why I am like I am cause I'm like her ,
Because my mom love Valium and lots of drugs , That why I'm on what I'm on cause I'm my mom

Wait a minute this aint dinner this is paint thinner , You ate it yesterday I aint hear no complaints did I
Now here's a plate full of pain killers now just wait till I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes you little mother fucker ill make you sit there and make that retarded fucking face without even tasting it , you better lick the fucking plate you aint wasting it , Put your face in it before I throw you in the basement again ,
And I aint giving in , your gonna just sit there in one fucking place spinning again till next thanksgiving and if you still aint finished it I use the same shit again then when I make spinach dip it will be placed into shit , you little shit want to sit there and play innocent , A rack fell and hit me at k mart and they witnessed it , child support , your father he aint sent us shit and so what if he did that aint none of your dang business kid

My mom there's no one else quite like my mom I know I should let bygones be bygones

With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead

I was born with a dick in my brain , yeah fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed 'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back , I want my dick sucked in the shed
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead
After I fuck you in the butt , get some head , Bust a nut , get some rest
The next day my mother said I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead
Debbie don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there , stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck I bet you he's fakin' it ,
I bet you I bet he probably just wants to see how upset you would get I'll go handle this of course , unless you object
Ah go fuck his brains out , if any's left in his head

Then you would know I've completely lost it Is he nuts NO He's insane

Did you get him Naaw , fucker tried to bite my face off I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw , bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades , stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face , let the thing pop
Took his eye out , picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants , he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything , except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw Yeah maniac , that's Shady dog
Man that motherfucker's gangsta , ain't he dog
Shady dog , what be going through that fuckin' brain of yours
Say no more , what the fuck you waitin' for , sing along

Then you would know I've completely lost it Is he nuts NO He's insane

Don't you know what felch means  , well then tell me Would you rather get felched or do the felching
Fuck him in the ass , suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp , belch , then go back for a second helping Can you dig what I'm sayin' man , can you smell me
I want you to feel me like my step father felt me 
Fuck a little puppy , kick the puppy while he's yelping Shady what the fuck you saying

Marshall I just love you boy , I care about your well being No Dad , I said no ,
I don't need no help peeing I'm a big boy , I can do it by myself see
I only get naked when the baby sitter tells me She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X , and they called it Pubic Hair on Chelsea
Well this is called ass rape , and we're shooting the jail scene


If you could count the skeletons in my closet Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it Is he nuts NO He's insane



Ohh , it's music to my ears
Oh man , how can I describe the way I feel
Fuckin' great , man
Okay , let me see , how could I begin

Locked in Mariah's wine cellar , all I had for lunch
Was bread , wine , more bread , wine and Cap'n Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up and in between snack crackers to munch

Mariah , whatever happened to us
Why did we have to break up All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's goin' through you mind
After such a nasty break up

With that Latin hunk Luis Miguel
Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin' , I want her back you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk

Mixed with Egyptian , with a little rap and punk
Zap and Eric Clapton shaft brings Abba crunk
And yeah baby , I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want

I mean I really want ya bad , you cunt
Nick , you had your fun , I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man , I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture


Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease for Pete's sakes , he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's goin' through my mind half the time
When my rhyme are blowin' up my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the 'Vacancy' sign on 'cause I'm gone blowin' up my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a mad man holdin' a glad

You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the miracle whip , a trickster
My signature sound when the tube of lipsticks surround
I'm bound to put it on in an instant , wow , man

What an ensemble , what an assortment of pharmaceuticals
This beautiful pill dust in my palm
Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama

I cut you like Dahmer , pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword , boy , I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea , nice knowin' ya Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin' , drop the shovel , boy

You don't know what the fuck you're doin'
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon you prick , I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucka born
Snuck up on Malakai and made the motherfuckers suck
On a shucka corn

Shucka , shucka corn , shucka corn
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fuckin' on
Now what the fuck are ya doin' You're runnin' over the snow blower
With the lawnmower blowing your bagpipes from Baghdad



In the bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothin' will stop me from molestin' you
Titty fuckin' you 'till your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles

Is what they said , to the two conjoined twins
How's it going girlfriends , you need a boyfriend
You need some ointment , just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first , we'll do a coin flip

I just got my one year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get goin' , how bad does the goin' get
Baby , you shouldn't have any trouble rubbin' groins with
Each other , especially when you're joined at the hip

I'm goin' to get the needle and thread from the sowin' kit
And attempt to separate 'em , and stitch them back at the loins , shit
Knew the little boy with the chocolate chips , ahoy chip
Cookie looky , even took me a Polaroid





Hello  allow me to introduce myself
My name is Shady
So nice to meet you
It's been a long time sorry I've been away so long
My name is Shady
I never meant to leave you

You see that chick in the gym checking me out
Any second I'm bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm wrecklessly wrecking the house
That was suppose to be breakfast , where the heck is it now
Here's the necklace I lost , right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope , guess I'll re - route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of your couch
Oh Jackpot Yea , 'Open Sesame' mouth
Down the hatchet , the feeling , you can't match it
A rap - tap - tap on your door with the damn wratchet  with a damn hatchet
A nap - sack - packed with like 40 - some Zan - exs
Shorty come back , I'm trying to score me some lapdances I'm bout to relapse so maybe pour me some Jack Daniels
Formula 40 - 40 and 40s with mad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at - ya


Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And are you menstruating baby , my little friend's waiting to say Hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shaking like Jello
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

My equilibrium is off , must me the Lithium I don't need to buy any drugs , man people give me 'em It just becomes everyday extracurriculum No reason in particular , it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151 51 people asleep in my damn living room
Scuse me hun But what is your name ,   next to ya naked and uh , did we umm
Of course we did , but didn't I strap Jimmy hun I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from  and I'm cool ,
I immediately run like Speedy Gon -  Zalez to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of threes , I'm fiending for some My head is pounding to the beat of the drum


Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow
Some are oval , and some are pink , some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

Oh , those were the days , they certainly were
It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good

I second that and a third , rush to emergency surgery to try to flush me because of the drugs that he purged
 the three - hundred bucks for these Perc - adins
Buster's getting to be where he lustfully surged it in
Pain it hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurting him'
Tirelessly on the phone trying to rustle up muscle relaxants for his back and a couple of packs
Since now he's doubling back - wards and he stumbling back
Slipped and fell , hit his back - bone , heard something go crack
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact I'm just busting my own chops while I'm bustin a rap
Resuscitated and re - juiced so fuck it , I'm back
And so I'm saying


Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow ,
Some are oval , and some are pink , some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

Hello  allow me to introduce myself My name is Shady
So nice to meet you It's been a long time sorry I've been away so long
My name is Shady I never meant to leave you

Pop star , icon , the whole works 

She played a little schoolgirl when she first burst

Upon the scene and seen that the world was hers

She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts

It irked me and made me mad at first I lashed out through my songs but what was really going on 

Was that I had developed a crush I just didn't know how to tell it to her 

Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her

Send her pictures of my collections of skeletons of , footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk 

We'll settle this once and for all , I'mma tell her at dusk Tonight , tonight is the night and tell her I must 

Creep up , to her mansion in stilettos and just climb the gate and ring the bell like hello my love ,

I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up

So blatantly but silently cuz I know that she's sound asleep

Who's wakin' me so violently and why is he on top of me

He's rapin' me she try's to scream somebody please get him off me

He's tapin' me he's biting me he's laughing likes it's funny

She's scrapin' me she's fightin' me she's scratching like some dumb freak

Escapin' me no dice ya see I might just be Ted Bundy

Or Satan gee what a site to see I'm dancing in my red panties

I'm crazy but it's alright with me man life can be so empty

Stay away from cuz I'm dancing to quite a different drum beat


Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart

Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't

Boy you think you're clever don't ya

Girl you think you're so smart

Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark Stay Wide Awake


A world so dark

A world so cold

A world where only some will go

But not return , when will they learn

Were do they go , god only knows

Stay Wide Awake


Better try to stay wide awake or you might be found dead by the lake

Soon as you lay me down to sleep bitch your soul I'm a try to take

Pray for light today right away why do they try to fight today

I must make them pay twice as much might as well put the knife away

Now I use power tools how 'bout now are you in the shower

Scour you for 6 hours till outage your power outlets

How did ya figure out I was down in your basement now ya

Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there

Power there's no one fowler bound ya the tub they found ya

Face down in the tub I drown you with piles of downers around ya

Such nostalgia and power such prowess look how you cower

Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' star wars

Jabba the Hut be di bye bye , be di bye bye it's time to die die

Ought to not even bother to scream it don't even matter

Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya

Not your everyday Damien bath me in holy water

Melting like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand

Where's the thrill in a hunt there's no fun in that here I come with axe

Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' him up with that

What was that dial 911 someone's comin' in from the back


Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart

Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't

Boy you think you're clever don't ya

Girl you think you're so smart

Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

Stay Wide Awake


A world so dark

A world so cold

A world where only some will go

But not return , when will they learn

Were do they go , god only knows

Stay Wide Awake



Good evening This is your fucking captain speaking

We will soon be reaching an altitude of four million and a half feet 

That's eight million miles in the sky

Please , undo your seatbelt for takeoff

You are now free to smoke about the cabin 


I'm Dre from back in the day from NWA from black and the gray from 

Choking a bitch to smacking her face from

Stacking up bodies to 

Racking their kegs up from Racking a bitch to

Stacking them crates up 

I'm still hungry 

And I'm back with a tapeworm 

And we was happening and rapping and tame at me 

Shady for us competition  Faggot , There ain't none 

Speak of the devil  It's attack of the rain man 

Chainsaw in hand , blood stain on my apron 

Soon as the blade spun run , they run away from

 Who wanna play dungeon 

No one is safe from  In search of a brain surgeon 

A great one 

Wait , the day ain't funny man  It's urgent 

I need one 

Two boxes of detergent and a paint gun 

And an emergency squirt gun to spray A - 1 


So one more time for old time's sake 

Dre , drop that beat and scratch that brake 

Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way And let's go 

You are now smoking with the best  


Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless

A nice environment 

Surprised , entirely hypnotized by the sound I surround the hydrants 

Taking lives of firemen Say goodbye , here I am again Naked wives and vicadin 

Before I begin to get so high; pussy boy , I could spin Fin , fin 

Fuck the handle I fly off the hinge Let that boy off the bench , coach and throw it to him 

There he goes in his trench coat , no clothes again 

Baby , make us some French toast and show us some skin 

I show you every inch grows of my foreskin 

Show me nipple I pinch , throw up , and throw up a ten 

Now you know it's a sin to tease , blow us again 

The sorcerer of intercourse  -  if it's forced , it's him 

Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within 

And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain 


So one more time for old time's sake

 Dre , drop that beat and scratch that brake 

Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way

And let's go You are now smoking with the best 


Now where there's smoke , there's fire Where there's fire , there's flames 

Where there's flames , there's chronic

Either you high or you ain't 

I got no time for no games Nah uh , he ain't playin'

He's gonna get the AK and aim it right at your brain I'm slightly insane Vodka and kreatine Hypnotic and red bull 

It's an incredible energy drink And it's given me wings I believe I can fly 

While I pee on a girl You won't catch me , CSI It's as easy as pie 

And as simple as cake Dre , get on the mic and make them dribble and shake 


Now put your smoke up in the air And raise your henny and coke 

And if you really wanna get fucked up , just let me know

We can smoke till there's no more lighter fluid to do it

Lets get into it You smoking with the triest and truest 

I got the Midas touch When it comes to rolling shit up

You motherfuckas ain't smoking 

You just holding shit up Now here we go

Let's get up , get down , hold up a blunt 

I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one

Cuz if at first you don't succeed , won't hurt to smoke some weed

Now them words are just a little more personal for me

Seeing is how I blew up off of puffing them trees Well puffing ain't enough for me 

Fuck yeah , light it up Cheech , come on Smoke me out , cuz

Give me contact buzz 

Get me on track They love me when I'm on that stuff

But this earth calling Shady , man come on back 

Man we're losing him; he won't even respond back  

Now look at all the pretty women in here 

Dre , it's hot 

I think we better go check on their temperatures I give them the thermometer 

You get the bandages Now baby just bend over

This won't hurt a damn bit , 


And give me one more time for old time's sake Dre , drop that beat and scratch that brake 

Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way

And let's go

You are now smoking with the best  

I said one more time for old time's sake Dre , drop that beat and scratch that brake

Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way

And let's go 

You are now smoking with the best 



Yea ,  , yea yea , oh
I feel like dancing , I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me high
I said I smell something in the air that's making me high


 do - re - me - fa - so - fa - so - la - ti - da - so
Lyrical Roscoe kick back a Tabasco
You motherfuckers must just not know the tic -  toe so
Time to show you the most kick - ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick - axe a sick asshole
Tic - tac - toe 'cross your six -  pack with X - acto
Knives , stranglin' wives with thick lasso
Big bags of the grass , Zig Zags , I'm with the Doc , so
You know how that go -  skull and the cross bones
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
You do not wanna try this at home my little vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six - pack , sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn watch the show , and just rock slow
It's not what you expected , nor what you thought so
'Bout time that you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke


It must be the ganja , it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
I said it's the ganja it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind


Your dreams are getting fulfilled , ooh I'm literally getting a chill
Spitting at will , me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
Your submitting to skill , sitting still I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel
Like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma , I can be Dahli Lama
And be calm or bring drama step beyond a Jeffery Dahmer
Please don't upset me mamma , yer lookin' sexy mamma
Don't know if it's the la - la or the rum and Pepsi mamma
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping next time I make a pizza
How many people you know who can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row
Put 'em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in the model the make the plate
And which model which lake they found her and how they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
Which knife and which gun , what kid what wife and which nun
Don't stop I like this it's fun , the fuckin' night's just begun




When I'm behind the mic , dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that your tryin' to light
Behind the boards sits Dre , legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say , this is the way it should be
Maybe you need some lyric serum syrup for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote now you give him some
He can give her some , she can give them some , get behind a Linn Drum
Make up a beat and cure the sucker syndrome
The spinnin' drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the endin' of
Capable of winning a Pulitzer so unbelievable it's a
Titanium cranium that's full of sur - 
Prises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos high
Good evening , this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything I ain't even drinking





DMC we have a mid 30s male
Found down unresponsive
Possible over dose
Substance unknown
Pulse is 60 and thready
Respiration's 8 he's intubated
And we're bagging him now
Uuh BP 90 over palp
Patient cool pale and diaphoretic
Has aspirated
Uuh GSC is 3
We'll update en route
ETA 10 minutes

As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Start off with the NyQuil like I think I'll just have a taste
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like ya that's great
I go to take just one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face Mommy , something is wrong with dad , I think
He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat

Sometimes I feel so alone ,
I just don't know ,
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold
It's like something takes over me ,
Soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like deja vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know

Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a fucking year
And that fucker still talks to me he is all I can fucking hear
Marshall , come on , we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be half buzzed for half of the time
Who's that mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rational man I got half a mind
To have another half of glass of wine sound acinine
Ya I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch , look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncy ball
Shit must have knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow , what the fuck happened last night , where am I
Man fuck am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache
Shit half a Vicodin , why can't I
All systems ready for take off , please , stand by

Sometimes I feel so alone ,
I just don't know ,
Feels like I been down this road before ,
So lonely and cold ,
It's like something takes over me ,
Soon as I go home and close the door ,
Kinda feels like deja vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know

So I take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ah
A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die
Oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use
There's new rules it's cool if it's helping you to get through
It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new Fuck it , what would Elvis do in your shoes
Now here I am three months later full blown relapse
Just get high until the kids get home from two homes relax
And since I'm convinced that I'm insomniac I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take 3 naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
That's an Ambien each nap how many Valium Three
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
OK , so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken four years just to put out an album beat
See me and you we almost had the same outcome heath
Cause that Christmas you know the pneumonia thing
It was Bologna was it the methadone ya think
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Your VCR tape cases with you Ambient CR great places to hide ain't it
So you can lie to Hallie
I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Alaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor Damn

Sometimes I feel so alone ,
I just don't know ,
Feels like I been down this road before ,
So lonely and cold ,
It's like something takes over me ,
Soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like deja vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know



Lately I've been hard to reach , I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me , like I'm reaching out for you


I'm just so fuckin' depressed , I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump ,
I took my bruises , took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet , and I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow
But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today , gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes , just to see
What it's like , to be me
I'll be you , let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain , you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful , oh
They can all get fucked
Just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh , they can all get fucked
Just stay true to you , yeah , so

I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Just as soon as I walk in
It's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that then it opens the door for conversation
Like I want that I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking man servant
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of them ain't even funny like
Ha , Marshall you're so funny man , you should be a comedian , God damn
Unfortunately I am , but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell , we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes , just to see
What it's like , to be me
I'll be you , let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain , you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh they can all get fucked
Just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh they can all get fucked
Just stay true to you so

Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip them , don't expect no help
Now I could have either just
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
In every single place
Every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid

Aunt Edna always told me Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes , at least
What size you wear I wear tens
Let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes , just to see
What it's like , to be me
I'll be you , let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain , you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful , oh
They can all get fucked
Just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh , they can all get fucked
Just stay true to you , yeah , so


Lately I've been hard to reach , I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
So are you calling me , are you trying to get through , oh
Are you reaching out for me , like I'm reaching out for you
So oh oh


Yeah To my babies Stay strong
Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world , God gave you them shoes
To fit you , so put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself , man , be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny ,
Don't ever let no one tell you , you ain't beautiful
So



A lot of people ask me
Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit I don't know
But I do know  -  I'm back now


Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run , to run to now
I've disappeared , you'll wonder how
Looking for me , I'm underground

Dre I'm down here under the ground
Pick me up , broken tibias fibias yeah fix me up
60 sluts , all of them dying from asphyxia
After they sip piss through Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups , toxins , boxes of oxipads
Enough oxi - cotton to send a fucking ox to rehab
Whack job in the back in a black stocking cap
Jacking off to a hockey mask at a boxing match 
Yes he can , I just did faggot , now guess again
Better text message your next of kin , tell em shits about to get extra messy especially when I flex again
Throw a fucking lesbian into wet cement
Faggidy , faggidy , fagidy , ragidy Ann and Andy ,
NO Ragidy , Andy and Andy
NO It can't be , it can't be
Yes it can be , the fucking Antichrist back Danny and Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville , calamity god damn it insanity pills fanny pack filled with Xanax
Through every nook and cranny looking for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk
Negligee lookie
Razor blades with me to make you bleed ,
Cases of Maybelline make - up laying on the table of weed
Slim Shady shit sounds like a fable to me
Until he jumps out of the fucking toilet when you're taking a pee


Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run , to run to now
I've disappeared , you'll wonder how
Looking for me , I'm underground

Six semen samples , 17 strands of hair
Found at the back of a van after the shooting at the vanity fare
Hannah Montanna prepare to elope from a can opener and be cut open like a cantaloupe and canopy beds
Glad bags , yeah glad to be back , 'cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dead in rehab
Fucking doctor , I didn't understand a damn what he said I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton , I ain't enlightened
Biting into a fucking Vicadin like I'm a viking
Oh Lightning is striking , oh might be a fucking sign , not like I need a psychic
Evaluation fuck Jason it's Friday the 19th
That means it's just a regular day and this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fucking lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay , missing both legs and begging to stay


Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run , to run to now
I've disappeared , you'll wonder how
Looking for me , I'm underground

Tell the critics I'm back and coming to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions and split a bag of fonions
Mad at me understandable , cannibal shoot an animal out of a cannon and have him catapult at an adult
Captain of a cult , with an elite following to turn Halloween back into a trick or treat holiday
Have Micheal Myers looking like a liar , swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Vorhees with 40's
Stuck a suppository up his ass and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lecter a fucking nectarine sat him in a fucking fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm street with a fucking wiffle bat drew fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissor Hands too
Came out with a little scratch , ooh
Looking like I got in a fucking pillow fight with a triple fat goose
Insanity , can it be vanity , where is the humanity
And having a twisted fantasy with an arm and leg amputee
Straight jacket with a hundred eight brackets
With a strap that wraps twice around my back then they latch it
Cut your fucking head off and ask you where you're headed off to ,
Get it Headed off to 
Medic this headache's awful
This anesthetic is pathetic so is this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushing my hard taco


Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run , to run to now
I've disappeared , you'll wonder how
Looking for me , I'm underground

So , it wasn't a choice , it was I had to do this
And now I'm 90 days clean and uh , that's all I have to share
Thanks

Thanks for sharing Brian , is there anyone else who would like to share this evening

Yeah I got something I want to share
When you walked through the door you were queer to me
So come here baby boy , just come here to me
You're a cock boy , everybody wants you
You're gayer than you would ever claim to
I won't have to rape you
So homie lay down down down , lay down down down , lay down down down , lay down lay down

Where's everybody going This always went over real big in gay a
OK wait , I got another one

It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man , ever man , ever man
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever man , ever man , ever man , ever man


Last name ever
First name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy I aint nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown , Nino
She insists she got more class , we know
Swimming in the money come and find me , Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball , chemo
Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like a album
Who'da thought a country wide tour'd be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal , I did it without one
Yeah nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness
Bitches


It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man , ever man , ever man
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever man , ever man , ever man , ever man


I used to have hood dreams
Big fame , big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Yall seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gon build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button , whaat , nuttin
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelles husband
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesnt
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnt
Youre such a fucking loser
He didnt even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing the stardom will turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I cant even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back


It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man , ever man , ever man
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever man , ever man , ever man , ever man


Ok , hello it's da Martian
Space jam Jordans
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you dont wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne thats what they got to say or mention
Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer
Im resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh , my foots sleeping on the gas
No brake pads , no such thing as last


It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man , ever man , ever man
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever man , ever man , ever man , ever man


There they go , packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go , macadamian they go so ballistic , whoa
He can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no Go for broke
His cup just runneth over , oh no
He aint had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
Theyve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You cant put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin with a few true villains
Whose stand inside of the booth truth spillin
And spit true feelings , until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way that you doubted me hows it taste
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
Im Hannibal Lecter so just in case youre thinking of saving face
You aint gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
So Drake


It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man , ever man , ever man
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever man , ever man , ever man , ever man



I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch , I want the fans jumping
I want them fists pumping in the air , I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks , Ladies won't you fill your cups
Shady's come to fill you up , if you a D or a C - cup
You can even be a B , it's just me and D - R - E
You'll be in the E - R , we are strapped with so much T - N - T
We may blow , no , not even C - P - R from the EMT
Can help you to resuscitate , You bustas must be flustered , wait
You can't cut the mustard , What's your problem , can't you bust a grape
 What's my name Shady came to crush the game
Instantly , not even fair to them cause they pale in comparisons
So much they might as well wear a skin , don't you wish you could just share his pen
Cause this shit is getting embarrassing , the fog is thick and the air is thin
Cause he won't even let them try to breathe , Dadidadidadadi
He makes it look so easy , Girl you just hit the lottery


Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us , you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go , it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose

So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose


This is when shit hits the fan like it just flat out don't stand
This is the only moment that matters , your homie rolling with Mathers
Then chaos erupts , Em's in back , Dre's in the front
So do what we say and once it's over like a suance , it hums

It's like the playoffs , just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off or what Man , you better lay off the blunts
You must be smokin' something , think I ain't smokin' nothing , stay off my nuts

Now hit the floor , baby , time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose , loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah , girl , shake that caboose , I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D - R - E is on the loose , I'm like a goose when it comes to the Chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose , Me and my goons are like animals
Wake up like a pack of wolves and we came here to extract the roof
Yeah , man , ain't that the truth Girl , your mans is like in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch , You swing All hell breaks loose


Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us , you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go , it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose

So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose


Now I know you're feelin discouraged but homie just mark my words
I'm mur - durin the flow , liquid courage I'm fin' to blow
As soon as we hit the do' power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit yo' hoe
With speakers knockin it's 3 o'clock , me and Doc then proceed to drop
E and hop out the vehicle and knock on your do'


Yeah , so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffin for nothin , we'll knock the stuffin out you
Revenge is so sweet , move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah , move it or lose it freak , move to the beat , lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there that'll be pretty damn stupid of me
Born and raised in the C - P - T , yeah Los Angeles , rules of the streets
Them haters hatin on me , but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce - deuce in the seat , Dre fall off that's news to me




It fits , perfect



Better watch out , sucka now I gotcha where I want ya

Onslaught , comin and I'm packin in my lunch up

Bunch of , missile launchers and a bunch of contra - 

 - band , van full of ganja , now come on jump

Man stop , mashin Marshall on my gotcha

Doin the cha - cha and the cucaracha with a quadra - 

 - plegic , boogeyin down to Frank Sinatra

Lindsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya

Who'da knew the buddah do to me what it's done

Such cynicism when this isn't in my system

Blunt hypnotism , lift the spliff up to my lips son

So much on my hands I got to give my kids a fist bump

Christo - pher Reeves swimmin in my swim trunks

Mister , help me 's what he said to me and then sunk

Women skinning and then cutting them up in chunks

In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin once



Once again they call me Buffalo Bill

Buffalo Bill , Buffa - Buffalo Bill

Skin 'em up , hem 'em , sew 'em up in those kilts

Up in those kilts , uppa - up in those kilts

Man you don't want to go up in those hills

Up in those hills , uppa - up in those hills

You better beware , stay clear of Buffalo Bill

Buffalo Bill , Buffa - Buffalo Bill



Always , you can see him lurkin in the hallways

Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawl space

How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place

Hide 'em in the wall , well how long will the drywall take

Well fuck it then , I got nothing but time , I'll wait

Until it dries for the moment I guess you're all safe

After I sand it and buff it I guess that I'll paint

My chainsaw's out of gas , my regular saw ain't

Now here I come again , damn stomach rumblin

You can even hear the evil spirits comin from within

Someone's in , the back of my damn house rummagin

It's a girl , she looks pretty thin , but I want to skin

Been , on the hunt again; when , will it ever end

Evelyn , why you tryin to fight You will never win

Severin , legs , arms , damn there goes another limb

Pull the lever then , trapdoor , death is evident





Now what you know about Buffalo Bill Nothin so chill

Fuckin whore you better fuckin hold still

Make sure none of that , lotion in the bucket don't spill

Cut 'em , gut 'em and just keep to stuffin those girls

Man I think she had enough of those pills

Sedate her then I'll wait , I'll come back later just to clutch on those steel

Blades , baby when I cut ya don't squeal

I hate the loud noises , I fuckin told you

I keep hearin voices like wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife

And push it right through her while you put ya shish - kabob skewers

Into her , barbecue her or would you do to her

What you usually do to a girl who's skin's newer
 In a world of sin you are , this is turnin into a

Torment tournament of sorts , Christmas ornament you are

I'll be sure to Ginsu ya 'til there's no more skin to ya

Boo - yah , who ya think you're fuckin with; duck because here he comes again





YoDre ManMake my vocals sound sexy ,
Come on man , come on man , okaaaay ,


It feels so wrong cause it feels so right ,
But its all right , its ok with me ,
I'll do my steps all by myself ,
I don't need nobody to play with me ,
But if you just give me a chance ,
I can put you in a trance the way I dance ,
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm
Taking My Ball and going home , hooome ,


I'm that guy man ,
Shove a diamond up my hind end ,
And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals ,
Slut poke holes in ya shirt , jump in mud puddles ,
While I stomp mudholes in ya ass girl ,
Now lets cuddle ,
Blood curdling your gurgling on your blood ,
What I do for my next trick ,
Im feeling won - der - ful ,
I think I might just do something a little less subtle ,
Shove a fucking tonka truck up a little kids butthole ,
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador of the valentines day massacre slash assassin
I slash her in the ass with a icicle
And leave her laying a blood bath
While I put a catheter in
And jump in the bath with her ,
In my spiderman mask man
Just imagine the fun I can have with a strap on ,
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon ,
Are those pistachio's damn , I'd like to have some ,
Laying on the patio man , rolling a fat one ,
Shady drop the magic marker , put the cap on ,
God damn man are you that much of an asshole ,




I'm like houdini ,
Tuck my teenie eenie weenie between each
One of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie ,
Make the shit disappear like tara reid in a bikini , believe me homie ,
You don't know the meaning of a meanie ,
They call me the fruit loop from jupiter ,
I'm trying to maneuver the hoover up in your poop shoot ,
Dont move or ya might get it stuck so fucking far up in your uvula
You aint gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus ,
Totally tubular sniffing glue through a tube in the studio
Now who do ya think is more fruitier ,
Weenier smoothered in peanut butter putting on a tube of ya eye shadow and man it look nice ,
You should've seen it mother ,
I think I'll put a piece of art on my visa card ,
Then I'll go meet Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosy on over to Rosie - o - Donnell's
With McDonald's jump on her lap and watch the Sopranos




Shady what are you doing chewing on a human ,
Grab an aluminum bat hit Heidi Klum in the back , BOOM
Assuming the fact that dudes in the back room
Using the bathroom vacuum and a racoon ,
Skewing a rat a cat screwing a baboon ,
You shouldn't ask what is he doing with that broom ,
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds ,
You in a trance , I'm back doing my dance ooh ,
But there afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair
And make her wear a bathing suit and take her para sailing
Shady why you gotta pick on the lady for ,
Why you make her read 84 bed time stories to you in baby talk
Cause I'm scared there's monster's under my bed ,
Kelly Pickler hid my juice box under my bassinet ,
No wonder my ass is wet my diaper needs to be changed ,
You like graffiti dike , well I can pee pee and write your name ,



Fine nobody wants to play with me 
Fuck you then bitch
You guys are always mean to me anyways 
All you ever do is rub gum in my hair and stuff
You guys are gonna make memake me sad I'm sad
I'm gonna cryI'm crying
I'm going' tell my mommom



Yeah
Yeah girl
Can you hear that
It's playing our song
Are you sleepy
Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark are ya


You hear the beat As it makes ya Not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door It's locked so I go to creep
'round the back with binoculars Not 'cause I want to peep
But because I'm hungry She smells like taco's I want to eat
Visions of hot choclatey marshmallows Also sweet
With sugar plums Oh look , here comes Marshall he's on your street
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em He's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey A holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast With strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers With Jon Benet Rams
I guess a modern day jack the ripper Is all that I am
My music box


Cause when the lights are off , I see the girl's asleep
But i can hear u my love , you keep calling me
I want the world to know , you mean the world to me
So when you call me to come , I will answer
Cause when the lights are off , I see the girl's asleep
I hear my music box , playing a song for me
So wont you whirl around , and do a whirl for me
And want you be my private dancer


I almost look comatose , Who wants to be sobered gross
I foam like a doberman , mouth open I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils , in both my holes and I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size , eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mother's make up , get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around , I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder , I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
The devils upset with his wife , they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out , but what the fuck about
Voices are leading me up to the attic , I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse , the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest , but what do I do , it's locked
I pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig til I find it , I wind it up and the tune just starts
It's playing a song , so beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full , I smell a funeral , guess I'll loom in the park




I'm fixated on asphyxating and breakin' this little chick's
Neck like a pixie stick
The sick Satan worshippin' , bitches get horse - whippins ,
I'm in the back , through the back door , slip in
Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortition of love , sent from above ,
Forced entry , the more wenchy , the more stingy I become
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century , I'm just numb
Am I dreamin' , is it real Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up , gotta roll me the ladder
I'd had enough of the chatter , climb up to the window , look at her
And climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her
with the bat , a matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that , I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments , back - to - back , like Tabatha
I'm your secret admirer , I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight , but you're no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight , as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs , simple as that , cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens , then pan back , the camera
Stand back , cuz here comes your man Jack , so Pamela





Yeah boy ,
dem better to ring the alarm boy ,
Dem know what's coming boy ,


Oh my God , fucking Bomboclat
I'm hard as Kenard , the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire ,
Tie a whore up with barbwire , nothing but a bra boy ,
I'm the real deal , and charbroil her on the bonfire ,
And Bon Voyage bitch , I'm like Chef Boyar - 
 - dee in this bitch; send a bomb to my moms lawyer
Im a problem for ya , boy you think your Tom Sawyer ,
Til I pull you out the fucking story book and stomp on ya ,
Fucking fictitional characters and fariytales ,
Prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris Wheels ,
But it aint fiction its fact boy beware its real
Them lyrics you wield equals zero to a hero shield
Mister fly - by - the - seat - of - his - pants parasail
Fall , hit the trampoline , bounce and grab a pair of stilts
And I aint wearing zilch , zip , zero , nothing , no nada ,
Like you fa'da fucking you're ma'da


Drop the bomb on em ,
Please don't drop the bomb on me ,

All I got to do is point to the spot ,
When the bomb drops boy does it drop ,
And when it does boy there's a problem ,




Boy dont jinx yourself ,
Boy I'm Michael Spinks with the belt ,
Stringer Bell boy , my name rings bells for itself ,
I'm sick as hell boy ,

Bringing hell , boy singing telegrams will get dealt ,
And to that boy on them sedative meds
Who said he was better ,
I bet he never seen Freddie in a Black and red little sweater ,
Back better than ever ,
The chedder shredder the grater the beef grinder
I'll settle vendettas a little later ,
Giving haters incubators , think ya made a mistake ,
By saying shady was ghost I aint even close the gate
You 'bout one foot in the grave , just stay put and behave ,
Im bout to turn this fucking place to Beirut in a day
So hey wouldn't you say I'm the shit ,
Couldn't agree with ya more , If you were to say that my fuckin shit doesn't stink ,
Shady fuckin' Aftermath boy , the ship doesn't sink ,
It just floats in the fucking water , till we fill up the tank ,





Cause some things just don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
So on a bigger stage they came to see you spit your game
Ooooohhhhhhh
It shouldn't be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again , you hate the fame
Love the game , cold as ice you remain
Fuck em' all , tell 'em all eat shit , here we go again

So , god damn is it that time again already
Haha , you don't look too happy to see me
Fuck man , don't everybody welcome me back at once

Motherfucker might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John , cause I'm just a mean cock sucker
This shit is on , cause you went and pissed me off
Now I'm shitting and pissing on everybody
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So buck the Buddha , light a bong
But take a look at mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song , c'mon


Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh , I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be - low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo - blo - blo - blo - blo - blows
Oh oh oh oh oh


Fuck it I'm a loose cannon , Bruce Banner's back in the booth
Ya'll are sitting ducks , I'm the only goose standing
I set the world on fire , piss on it , put it out
Stick my dick in a circle , but I'm not fucking around motherfucker
I'll show you pussy footin , I'll kick a bitch in the cunt
'Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin' , you musta mistook me for some sissy
Soft punk looking for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead , fucking hater push me
I told you ain't no fucking way to shush me
Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy , G's up
All you gardeners freeze up , put your hoes down 
Man chill , nah I can't god damnit
Rap is a landfill , drop the anvil
These are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens the world'll stop spinning
And Michael J Fox'll come to a stand still
During an earthquake , urine in your face
Cause you're fake , ahh what the fuck , that hurt wait
Ahh what the fuck , I just got struck by lightening
Alright then I quit , god I give up
Call it evil that men do , lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins , I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you , if you continue
To hell I'll send you , and just then the wind blew and I said

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh , I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be - low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo - blo - blo - blo - blo - blows
Oh oh oh oh oh


How long will I be this way Shady until my dying day
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
So long , 'til then I drop the fucking bombs
Like I miss the pass when I went long
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along , slut this , slut that , learn the words to the song
Oh bitches don't like that , homie I'll be nicer to women
When the aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming
Man I'm a cold soul , I roll solo so
So don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges , peaches to plums yeah
I'm bananas pussy , cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear , you try to diss me , I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything , like everyone does with auto - tune
That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh , I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be - low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo - blo - blo - blo - blo - blo - blows
Oh oh oh oh oh


Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I don't know , I don't know what caused , I don't know what caused me to be this way
I don't know , I don't know but I probably be this way 'til my dying day
I don't know why I'm so , I'm so cold mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me



Ayo Before I start this song man
I just want to thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out


Is anybody out there
It feels like I'm talkin to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me
I guess I keep talkin to myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one who's crazy

Yeayah
Woah wah
Woah wah 
Woah wah
Woah wah 


So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me , I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there
Who feels the way I feel
If there is , let me hear just so I know I'm not the only one


I went away I guess to open up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew that I was going through growin' pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins
On the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissin Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself
He was spittin and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too
God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic
Thank God that I didn't do it
I would've had my ass handed to me
And I knew it but Proof wasn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth poppin another pill tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid You gon' start dissin people for no reason
Especially when you can't even write a decent punchline even
You're lying to yourself , you're slowly dying , you're denying
Your health is declining with your self - esteem , you're crying out for help






Marshall you're no longer the man , that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowin' , self - loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle
Maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though
But I must be talkin to the wall though
I don't see nobody else 
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater , I've put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not a egomaniac that's not his motto
He's not a desperado he's desperate , it's starting to bottle inside 'em
One foot on the brake one on the throttle
Fallin asleep with writers block in the parking lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something about it
Admit you got a problem you brain is clouded you pouted long enough
It isn't them it's you you fuckin baby
Quit worrying about what they do and do shady
I'm fucking going crazy






So I pick myself off the ground and fuckin swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice suffice this time around
It's different them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs , Relapse I was flushing em out
I've come to make it up to you no more fucking around
I've got something to prove to fans cause I feel like I've let em down
So please accept my apology I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again , let me formally reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowin up , pullin up , blowin up , all over
My life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos
I'm back with a vengeance , homie , Weezy keep ya head up ,
TI , keep ya head up , Kanye , keep ya head up ,
Don't let up , keep slayin em
Rest in Peace to DJ AM
Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day






So there it is 
Damn
It feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was man
Ay yo
And to anybody who thought about going there , it was never nothing personal , some shit I was going through
And to everybody else
I'm back  haha



Yeah Ya Know Critics Man
Critics Never Got Nothin Nice To Say man
You know the one thing I notice about critics man
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Well imma tell em


Yesterday my dog died , I hog tied a ho , tied her in a bow
Said next time you blow up try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog try a little mo
I'm so tired of this I could blow , fire in the hole
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter here I go
Flows tighter , hot headed as ghostrider
Cold hearted as spiderman throwin a spider in the snow
So ya better get lower than Flo - Rida inside of a lowrider with no tires in the hole
Why am I like this why is winter cold
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes
Listen dog Christmas is off this is as soft as it gets
This isnt golf this is a blisterin' assault
Those are your wounds this is the salt
So get lost
Shit dissin me is just like pissin off the wizard of oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze beat you in the jaws with it
Grab the scissors and saws and
Cut out your livers gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then discribe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make chris piss in his draws
Ticklin him go to his grave , skip him and visit his dog


You on fire
Thats how ya know your on a roll
Cause when you hot its like your burnin up everyone elses cold
Your on fire
Man I'm so fuckin sick I got ambulances pullin me over and shit
Your on fire

Your on fire your on fire


I just wrote a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses if you mistook the for a song , look
This aint a song its a warnin to brooke , hogan and david cook
That the crook just took over so book
Run as fast as you can , stop writin and kill it
Im lightning in a skillet your a fuckin flash in a pan
I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin a fan
Mr mathers is the man
Yeah I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Salivas like sufiric acid in your hand itll eat through anything metal the ass of iron man
Turn him into plastic so for you to think that you could stand a fuckin chance is assanine
Yeah ask the nine man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
Fuck it I aint playin
Pull up in a van and hop out at a homeless man holdin a sign sayin
Vietnam vet I'm out my fuckin mind man
Kick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand
So if I seem a little mean to you this aint savage you aint never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route
You couldnt make a belemic puke on a piece of fuckin corn and peanut poop
Sayin you sick quit playin you prick dont nobody care
Then why the fuck am I yellin at air
I aint even talkin to noone cause aint nobody there
Nobody will fuckin test me cause these hos wont even dare
Im wastin punchlines but I got so many to spare I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw dont waste it save it psycho yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about michaels hair

Yeah Oh Get Up I said get up Let's go
Better watch out , now
Here we come 
And we ain't stoppin' until
We see the mornin' sun 
So give us room to do our thing
Cause we ain't come to hurt no one 
So everybody come on get up on the floor
Right now and grab someone 


Now first of all I'm the boss
I just wanna get that across
Man even my Dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto likes it's a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows
Spray - painted doors with the flames on 'em
Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
Baby , Shady's here come on get him
If you dames want 'em
But he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid , why you tryin' to put your claims on him
Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it , that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home , now could I get that lap dance
She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass man
In the streets of Warren , Michigan we call 'em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me , time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussy who's the man
Now , get in , dance


Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
It ain't no one but us trash
You dunno , you better ask somebody
Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party


Pull a fifth of Bacardi from outta my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Livin' Dead
And tomorrow I probably still be too high to get outta bed
Til I feel like I been hit wit the sharp part'a the hammer
Mixin' Hennessey and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like I'm hollerin' Die Santa
Missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryin' ta play the wall like you balling
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap , darlin'
Cause as soon as they throw on some R - Kelly I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for the ladies in the mini's
But I'm not throwin' ones , fives , tens , or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters , nickels , dimes , pennies up at skinnies
Man I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's
From the north , east and west , but when
It comes to them trailers in them South Parks
Muffle it , cause homie that hood's tighter than Kenny's
So ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outie
Now hop in my minivan , let's get rowdy
C'mon


Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno , you better ask somebody
Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party


Now whether you're black , white or purple
If you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck
You ain't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil
And you're no damn good
Get on the floor , man , and rep your 'hood
Now honey , don't let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot
Cause girl I got a sick wip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk
Rip out the stick shift and
Make a five seater
I'll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain't like me to split a piece 'a dry pita
I'll be the S - L to the I - M to the S - H - A - D - Y
And I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
I'll rip a tree out the ground
And flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf , clown
I'll tell ya now
I'm so raw I still need to un - thaw
You feel me , yall
I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby , a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Cold slaw containers , empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up


Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno , you better ask somebody
Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party



I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes


Lately I really , feel like I'm rolling for delf like Philly ,
feel like I'm losing control of myself , I sincerely
Apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complaining ,
But life keeps on complicating , and I'm debating ,
On leaving this world , this evening , even my girls
Can see I'm grievin' , I try and hide it ,
But I can't , why do I act like I'm all high and mighty ,
When inside I'm dying , I am finally realizing I need help
can't do it myself , too weak , two weeks I've been having ups and downs ,
going through peaks and valleys , dilly dallying ,
round with the idea of ending the shit right here
I'm hatin' my reflection , I walk around the house tryin' to fight mirrors ,
I can't stand what I look like , yeah , I look fat , but what do I care
I give a fuck , only thing I fear is Hailie ,
I'm afraid if I close my eyes and I might see her ,
Shit




I lock myself in the bedroom , bathroom , nappin' at noon ,
Yeah dad's in a bad mood , he's always snappin' at you
Marshall , what happened that you can't stop with these pills ,
And you falling off with yer skills , and your own fans are laughin' at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle , get up ,
Be a man , stand , a real man would've had this shit handled
 know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed ,
They say Proof just flipped out , homie just whipped out and bust ,
Nah , it ain't like Doody to do that ,
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at nobody , he'd fight first ,
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse ,
Now I'm popping Vic's , Perks and Methadone pills
Yeah Em , tight verse , you killed it
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men ,
And they gon' do whatever I says when I says it ,
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend , so fuck it , I guess then





My friends can't understand this new me ,
That's understandable , man , but think how bananas you'd be ,
You'd be an animal too , if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you , what you want me to do
I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame's startin' to give me an excuse to be at a all time low
I sit alone in my home theater watchin' the same damn DVD
Of the first tour , the last tour he was still alive
And it hurts so I fast forward , sleepin' pills will make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night ,
I'll just take a couple more , yeah you're motherfuckin' right ,
I ain't slowin' down for no one , I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma , yeah homie come on dole 'em out
Daddy , don't you die on me , daddy , better hold your ground
Fuck , don't I know the sound of that voice ,
Yeah baby hold me down






Wake up in the hospital , full of tubes , but somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof
I'ma do it just for Proof , I think I should state a few
Facts , 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit , it just hit me that what if I would not have made it through
I think about the things I would have never got to say to you ,
I'd never get to make it right , so here's what I came to do
Hailie , this one is for you , Whitney and Alaina , too ,
I still love your mother , that'll never change ,
Think about her every day , we just could never get it together
Hey , wish there was a better way , for me to say it ,
But I swear on everything , I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain , when it rains ,
guess it pours , yes , it does , wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't , I ain't placin' any blame ,
I ain't pointin' fingers , heaven knows I've never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history ,
And just today I looked at your picture , almost if to say ,
I miss you subconsciously , wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away , don't know why ,
I don't know what else to say , I guess I'm







I don't know man ,
Just feels like , we're a lot different , kinda feels like , we're on a whole different page right now
It feels strange but uh , I guess it's kinda like , it's kinda like

I feel like I'm morphing into something that's so incredible that I'm dwarfing , all competitors
Better get your girlfriend in check It's psychological warfare Endorphin side affect
His self esteem shatters his dialect Comes blasting out your deck , she loves me
Such passion you'd expect this sort of reaction from her Yet , you strong arm
You're fucking corny You try to turn your charm on 'cause you just think your bishop , the Don Juan
But if you think that you're fucking with me , homie you're on one
I'm cocking my head back like , Ed Lover C'mon son She's on my Johnson
She brings my name up constant Your boys are like , She's fucking with dude She wants him
Oh boy you better get a clue , she's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you What you expect her to do
How you expect her to act in the sack when she's closing her eyes , fantasizing of digging her nails in my back to this track

Seduction , seduce Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you , the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction , seduce Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you , the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

She sitting there getting liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you than to count the things that are
There's a seven disc CD changer in her car , and I'm in every single slot , and you're not Aww
I'm the logo on the Dallas cowboy helmet
The star , and I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhyming one syllable Aww
Switch it up , and watch them haters not give it up 'cause ya just not good enough
Well I'm not giving up til I get my respect , and I won't stop til I get enough ,
'cause I'm not living up to my own expectations Aww
That hater alarm is sounding off , that Obama took the bomb from my name Aww
So quit crying that I took your dame , homie she's my dame Aww
You sadly mistaking if you thinking that I'm not on my game , boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard on for me What you hollering my name for
It's your bitch on my dick Ain't my dang fault Man , I can't call it

Seduction , seduce Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you , the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction , seduce Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you , the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

It's like I'm playing lyrical tug of war with your ear You hear it girl , come here
Put your ear up to the speaker , dear , while I freak this world premier Seducing her
Loosing up with a little freestyle that'll wait , am I losing you Am I making you look bad
Well I got news for ya , homie , ya losing her Oh wait , she don't like when I spit it fast
Am I trying to show her how Let me slow it down some It's still gonna be a blow out
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit , and try to salvage something to see if you can save any of it ,
Punk but none of it's fucking with me Prick , you really feeling that bullshit
You think you killing them syllables Quit playing These beats ain't nothing to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like You are microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just aww struck She's love stricken
She's got her jaw stuck , from sucking my dick Aww Fuck

Seduction , seduce Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she wants you , the next she don't She's been stolen from you
So don't you seduce at what I do 'cause one minute she wants you , the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction , seduce Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she wants you , the next she don't She's been stolen from you
So don't you seduce at what I do 'cause one minute she wants you , the next she don't
She's been stolen from you



We touch I feel a rush
We clutch it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust , it's torturous
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just
Did the impossible
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you
And love is evol
Spell it backwards I'll show you

Nobody knows me I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfucking ho's
Bloodsucking succubuses , what the fuck is up with this
I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like trying to start over
I got a hole in my heart , but some kind of emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on 'til you toy with my emotions , so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold you , I wasn't joking when I told you
You take my breath away
You're a supernova and I'm a


I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you


I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries , no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same
You want them when they don't want you
Soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you must've been fate
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase
'Fore a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be making a mistake
Cause I'm a




So after a year and six months , it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you
Let down my guard swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap
Lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleading
I'm trying to stop you from leaving
You won't even listen so fuck it
I'm trying to stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezing
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house
And let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Then I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple
I told you this



And I would have did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now
It's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a


I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you
Without you



Yeah ,
You know , technically , I'm not even really supposed to be here right now ,
So fuck it , might as well make the most of it


Yeah , haha

Feels good ,

Whooo ,

Guess I'm lucky ,

Some of us don't get a second chance

But I ain't blowing this one

Naw man , haha

Shit I feel like I can do anything now

Who can catch lightning in a bottle Set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on the fire hose , flier than swatters

Cinderella man , Cinderella man , Cinderella man , Cinderella man

Smash an hourglass , grab the sand , take his hands and cup 'em ,
Spit a rhyme to freeze the clock , take the hands of time and cuff 'em

Cinderella man , Cinderella man , Cinderella man , Cinderella man

There's a storm comin' that the weather man couldn't predict ,
I start the bug prick , you better flee cause I get ticked

I got up I'm back to punch ya to the ground , ya trick ,
It's a trap , fuck my last CD that shits in my trash ,
I be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass ,
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye , so bat ya eyelashes ,
And keep winking and blowin' kisses 'cause you're flirting with death
I'm destroying your livelihood I ain't just hurtin' your rep' ,
I catch a flow and get goin' ,
No remorse I'm showin' , ain't slowin' for no one ,
Knowin' there is nothin' you can do about it
Zeroin' on the target like a marksman ,
The target is you
I shut ya lane down ,
Took ya spot , parked in it too ,
Arsenic flow , lighter fluid , saliva what can ya do
Go get ya crew to hype you up stand behind you like whoooo

That boy's hot enough to melt Hell , burn Satan too:
Fry his ass , and put his ashes back together with glue ,
See you can hate 'em , he don't blame you frankly he would too ,
This game could ill - afford to lose him , how bout you

Now guess who  ,
Here's a clue  ,
He came to the ball in a wife beater , lost his Nike shoe ,
It's in ya ass  ,
He's in ya ass , he's all up in your psyche too ,
Now what's his name

He struck it
Screamed Shut up at thunder ,
And flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward

Rewound the future to the present , paused it don't ask how ,
Fuck the past motherfucker he's the shit right now
He's

Cinderella man , Cinderella man , Cinderella man , Cinderella man

Cinderella man
Send the fellow Shady dane came to wrap the game up in cellophane ,
Raise up from hell he came ,
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story ,
Nor did he come to do the same ,
Or can't afford to be a label in this day and age ,
And at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly ,
So say bye ,
To the old HI
To the new , Que Sera
Consider it his last hurrah
Coup de grace
Raise 'em high in the sky ,
Keep 'em up
Time to bring the place alive ,
Thanks for being patient
I will make no more mistakes ,
Shit my potato's baked ,
Homie the veggies on my plate can fly ,
My fillet is smoking weed ,
Yea faggot the stakes are high
Shit I ain't even suppose to be here
By the grace of God ,
The skin on my teeth
And the hair on my nuts I skated by ,
Now y'all are on thin ice
With ankle weights I hate to lie ,
How fuckin' irritated are you
How much in your face am I
And ain't shit you can do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit and
And I'm the spittin' image
I'll mirror it
When I stand near it ,
Your pussy lyric ,
I cunt hear it ,
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists

Who
Here's a clue
He came to the ball in his wife beater ,
Lost his Nike shoe ,
It's in ya ass , he's in ya ass , he's all up in ya psyche too
Now , what's his name

Cinderella man ,
Cinderella man ,
Cinderella man ,
Cinderella ,
Cinderella man ,
Cinderella man ,

Cinderella man ,
Cinderella man ,
Cinderella man ,
Cinderella man ,

Music is my time machine
So call me
Cinderella man ,
Cinderella man ,
Cinderella man ,
Cinderella man



Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life

Too late

Caught in a chase
25 to life


I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed
But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid
Down and died for you I no longer cry for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
Imma take control of this relationship
Command it , and imma be the boss of you now goddamnit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you , totally devoted to you while I've stayed
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats , go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase it's time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
I told you , you'd be sorry if I fucking left
I'd laugh while you wept
Hows it feel now , yeah , funny ain't it , you neglected me
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate but it's ,


Too late for the other side 
Caught in a chase
25 to life

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life


I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Til I snap
Don't think I'm loyal
All I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time
You don't think so , do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you
Go marry someone else and make em famous
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
Feed em the same shit that you made me eat
I'm moving on forget you oh ,
Now I'm special I didn't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
It's ridiculous
And still I stick with this
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
You're addictive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em
My friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted
To the pain , the stress , the drama
I'm drawn in so I guess imma mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time imma
Ain't changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abyss
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list

Fuck you hip - hop
I'm leaving you , my life sentence is served bitch
And it's just


Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late
Caught in a chase
25 to life



Yeah
Ha hayou feel that baby
Yeah , I feel it too
Damn
You knowI'm so glad we could spend this time together
See , I'm not as crazy as you thought I was , am I
Heh

I'm the American dream I'm the definition of white trash balling ,
I'm right back on 'em , with the
 I can't call it
Same shit , different toilet , oh you got a nice ass darlin'
Can't wait to get you into my Benz , take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin' , you take me for a friend
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now , it all started with my father
I must have got my pimping genes from him , the way he left my mama
I'm a rolling stone just like him , word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me , baby I'll make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as me
I'm as calm as The breeze , I'm the bees knees , his legs and his arms I'm a
S - superstar , girl , I'm ready for you mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pyjamas


So bad
So good that I'm so bad
Guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuevo , first I kiss your navel
Work my way down , baby you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find something more stable
I told you I ain't fooling from the gate , this ain't the first day of April
But thank you for staying April , I'ma make you learn
To appreciate me , differentiate me
From these phoney , little fishy and sissy fake G's
Skip over the huggy - bear and all the kissyface , please
Initiate phase three Missy now service me
Take another shot of Jager , shake it so nervously
Take your time baby , ooh you're the bomb baby
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady
I told you I'm Shady , you didn't listen now , did you
Relax woman , you know that I'm only kidding with you
Got a twisted sense of humour , it's warped , but I didn't hit you
I think you're finally starting to get the picture , I'm




Dynamite , dynamite , dynamite , so
Dynamite , dynamite , dynamite , so
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go
'cause I'm on to the next girl ,
And the next girl I kinda like , oh , oh , oh

I got you caught up in the rapture
Make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped you
You never wanted someone so bad you're sweating
But if I'm what you wanted , why'd you panic when I grabbed you
Girl don't be so frantic I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's organic
You can't ignore it , so don't just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor , let's get to camcordin'
Damn shorty , I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin I was bound to work a number on your back and
Throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blinded you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup
so stop at a store , pick a pint up
Let's get the pineapple schnapps going , no one'll knock 'cause I'ma hang a sign up
Saying Don't Disturb , shorty I'm so superb
I say the right things , don't I spit the dopest words






 Ha ha
Dr Dre
2010
Light years ahead of youha ha
Who



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie


I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off her love , drunk from her hate ,
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer , I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown , she resuscitates me
She fucking hates me and I love it
Wait Where you going
I'm leaving you
No you ain't Come back
We're running right back
Here we go again
It's so insane cause when it's going good , it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back , she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful , I feel so ashamed I snapped
Who's that dude
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her , I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie


You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah , them chills you used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
You push , pull each other's hair , scratch , claw , bit 'em
Throw 'em down , pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in them
It's the rage that took over ,
It controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday
Yesterday is over , it's a different day
Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
Next time you show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie


Now I know we said things , did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns , same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded
Baby , please come back
It wasn't you , baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside , pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed , I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time There won't be no next time
I apologize even though I know its lies
I'm tired of the games I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
I'm just gonna


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie



The days are cold living without you 
The nights are long I'm growing older
I miss the days of old thinking about you 
You may be gone but you're never over


If Proof could see me now I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me now no one can beat me now
You try it'll be them doors on Dre's fans believe me clowns
That means suicide homie you'll never throw me
Off of this course blow me
Bitch I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all I'm not just talking awards homie
And the balls in my court and it's lonely
On top of the world when you're the only
One with the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no re
Morse remember that when they get to dogging you boy homie
So ya all can just get to blogging about bologna I'm not gonna stop the saga continues
No stopping the force Obi
I'm mopping the floors with em
I keep trying to pass it but they keep on dropping the torch and it won't be long til this sport is O - V - E - R
just Blaze and me we are knocking on doors and no we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch so be
Careful what you say there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S - N double O - P
Let me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn't travelling down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me


The days are cold living without you 
The nights are long I'm growing older
I miss the days of old thinking about you 
You may be gone but you're never over


And it don't stop oh
And it don't quit oh
And it don't stop oh
And it don't quit oh
And I miss you oh
I just miss you oh
I just miss you oh
Homie I'll never forget you no


For you I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic It'll put the dyna in mite
Yeah it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancing all over the beat it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Guess that the best thing I could do right now Doody for you is to rap
So I'm gonna fuck 'til I die yeah I'm a do it to death
And instead of mourning your death I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new heights step on the gas and accelerate I'm a need 2 mics
Cause the way that I'm feeling tonight everything I can just do right
There's nothing that I can do wrong I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped
Just finish the rhyme and bust it excuse this corny metaphor
But they'll never ketchup to all this energy that I've mustard
So God just help me out while I fight through this grieving process
Trying to process this loss is making me nauseous
But this depression ain't taking me hostage
I've been patiently watching this game pacing these hallways
You had faith in me always
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'm a show em blow em out the water slaughter em homes
I'm a own so many belts the only place they can hit me is below em
Homie I know I'm never gonna be the same without you
I never would've came in this game I'm going insane without you
Matter of fact it was just the other night had another dream about you
You told me to get up I got up I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight I was on my way to see you
You told me nah Doody you're not laying on that table I knew
I was gonna make it soon as you said think of Hailie I knew
There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I'm so thankful , please don't think that I don't feel grateful , I do
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song I dedicate this to you
I love you Doody


The days are cold living without you 
The nights are long I'm growing older
I miss the days of old thinking about you 
You may be gone but you're never over


And it don't stop oh
And it don't quit oh
And it don't stop oh
And it don't quit oh
And I miss you oh
I just miss you oh
I just miss you oh
Homie I'll never forget you no



Obie the person that came up introverted
Cause of nervousness that was solely the only verdict
It was worth it cause he changed became so observant
Serving such of a purpose
If you knew him earlier in his days its like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
That's why there's curtains in this murder if you gettin' worked up
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher
I had enough of isolating myself in a room
Writing poems and songs , doin' the same in school
Now look what he became , a fool
Cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
Living hard but still Juliard a god walks in but ain't spend a day in the pew
Regardless of this I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department


I stimulate the brain , mimic , emulate the sane
Cinic keep em' thinking its a fucking gimmick when it ain't
Clinically insane , brain is on Venus suck Uranus
Label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say
He may seem as though he's plain normal
If you ever meet him , greet him with a shake , see
He ain't as mean as what they say
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
So he's vague , so they mistake him for just bein' crazed
You part ways , your impression of him changed
You don't think he's strange , you turn around and tell him peace and thanks
Then you catch him flipping you off , with his pants down
Hands around his scrotum , tucking his fucking penis between his legs

Its all psychologic , why am I so maniacal ,
Am I psycho or some kind of psychotic stick ,
Or am I truly psychotic , or my molecules just diabolical ,
Cause biologically I defy logic , bye golly hall me off  on a trolly , probably wanna cracker , I'm back on the wacky tobacco ,
I'm a step away from crack Obie smack the shit outta me ,
I'm so slap happy man , snap me back to reality ,
Ima walking art gallery , a science museum ,
Elephantiasis of the nuts you probably die if you see em ,
I pull em out they hit the ground and probably crack the cement ,
I need an ambulance I cant just put em back in my pants



There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it
And when will he stop
Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just won't listen will ya , nah I guess not
You just can't can ya , man I can't stand ya
You're rotten , what you plottin' for us
Man when are you gonna let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better

Holy toledo it's Angelina Jolie amigo
She told me yo Shady just hand your penis to me I'll deep throat
And Brad if you try to stand between us then we're gonna see bro
Who was a fantasy I don't mean to damage your ego
You faggots wanna rassle I shove a fucking jar of vaseline up inside your asshole
And rope it shut with a lasso
Couple of crushed lexapro broken up wit the capsule or paxil
Just incase I ain't dope enough wit the raps though
Coke is cut with tobacco
Smoke it up then go wacko
This is what happens when you mix a cocunut with tabasco
Shady let go , the hoe has been choked up enough
Let her ass go
Not till Jessica Simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
I used to love her hooters now Carmen Elektra cuter
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
I'm off my fucking meds but I'm on an electric scooter
I might just scoot by and shoot my mum in the neck with rugers
Spit in Jasons face while I vomit on Freddy Krugar
They can't even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar
Now I'm gone get the rectal thermometer , get the lubra - 
cation and get the patient some Darvocet to chew cuz


There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it
And when will he stop


BoB I done told you once homie to easy up , geez
There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
Cause I will never lay down
And I will never let up



With the soul of a Sharman
I leave the beat than vomit
Like a bullemic woman with an uneasy stomach
I pass by people on the street they seem like sheep and zombies
Stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in
So can you hear me coming
Eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting
It's probably go diseases on it
I'm just being honest , I can see the comments
I can see the evolution as we creep up on it
I put that music in your veins like a needle junkie
Shit I just do this for the haters , I don't need the money
I diarrhea on track so it needs plunging
Somebody tell these girls please release my undies
Nobody really understands my language
I find it complicated just to hold a conversation
But still I got a whole lot of patience
Sittin' back watching Earth from my Space station


There's no need to say shit you already know

Oh my gosh I put Natasha Bendingfield in a washer
Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
Its like I got ya hypnotising like I gotcha
I gotcha pychologically fucked
Michael would like an apology what
Tell that psycho to stick a Tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
I'm as cold as a muthafucking icicle on my nut
I aint nuttin' nice , man I like to pull knives and I like to cut
The poster addict for post tramatic stress
I guess this is the most dramatic I've been in a while
This is the closest that its come to the Marshall Mathers
I can hear him start to gather
I don't paint the portrait of the picture perfect Partridge family
This ain't your orphan Annie , no this is more uncanny
Kick down Dakota Fannings front door while the whore is tanning

Of course he can , man he just saw her fanny then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties


There's no need to say shit you already know

So this time I'm goin' in


This the life of a rocker
jagermeister and vodka
Hoppin' off of the club's balcony
Into the crowd , surfin'
And when they drop me , I'm randomly sockin' fans
And when my interviews in hockey masks ,
Slap the journalists on their ass
I'm high off speed ,
Drivin' my car at high speed
Pocket full of weed , while lesbians follow me
I'm in the studio , envy
My h & m , gon' call for me
Cause I fell asleep on the soundboard , ain't get us off a week
So let's Bang all up in my head
Get 'em back ungrateful dead
Bustin' in the air , with 30 bitches up in my bed
I'm kickin' 'em out naked , and this the sympathy
Just ask me why I did it , well fuck it I can't remember


Fame , fame , fame
I think it's got me goin' crazy

So this time I'm goin' in


Some boys are wallin
Drinkin' , cussin' , and hyper smilin'
Been ridin' for days , tour bus look like ryker's island
Hand me jack daniel's , spray paintin' the die hard fan
Little cocker spaniel , fresh out of the damn zoo
Man you , better be conscious , I'm backstage
Livin' it up , with a couple of sluts feelin' nautious
We're drinkin' it's been a couple of days , since I've slept
My dick is sore from fuckin' , when I bust there's nothin' left
Just dust , back on the stage , give me my microphone
Strappin' with the audience as we perform hypersong
Our label presented us with a plaque
Brought it on stage , and bashed it to pieces with an aluminum bats , stanks
Now which one of you bitches down for the cause
Yeah I said my dick is sore but I ain't say shit about my balls
Last call then we off to the next city , yeah
Whatever I didn't drink on my bladder pack it up and take the rest with me


Fame , fame , fame

You were shittin on us too
But no one but us knew we were beefin'
Cause that's what happens when you beef with crew
It stays in the crew , cause it's just crew
But we're back now , yeah we took our time while our blood grew
Only thing we're in a hurry for now is to rush you
And we're back , these days if you don't got the guts or the nuts to
Pussy , go pick your pussy leaves off your cunt tree , fuck you
Ahh choo
Bless you I'm allergic to pussy , sluts too
Yeah , you think you the shit , till we flush you
Have some bullshit to readjust
Still got a just a few of us left , but it'd be unjust to rob us our just due
So rest in peace to Bugz and proof

But we can't stop now we done had too much of our blood drew from this

I'm a goat
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and I consider myself one of those
so thank you very much , here it goes

This is the part I was worried about
everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
and I'm in some dusty garage inhaling them carbon monoxide fumes
and everyone's telling me what I should do
and how I should come out and what to rap about
and I know I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out
and I'm not sure how this is gonna come off
they're probably gonna think that I'm coming off as cocky 
like I just started giving a fuck what you really think about me
see , the thing about me
is you don't really know a thing about me
everyone's making a stink about me
like there's some kind of a aura of that of the king around me
surround me with nothin' but gangsters , killers , and bangers
and the most dangerous criminals
and I feel like I'm more comfortable around them than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors
but , see , my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
but why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other emcees
so when Weezy says that he's better than Jay - z
please , be that just subliminally
means he thinks Jigga's the best and that he's
the only one up in that league , see
and it's easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is
knowing god damn well that I'm one of the best motherfucking rappers who ever lived period

I'm a goat
and I don't mean to gloat
but I know what I know and I know what you think
and these magazines'll never put it in ink
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and I consider myself one of those
so thank you very much , here it goes

Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game
so they gotta go try to find em a new Eminem
or a new Shady , if they think it's gonna happen
man , I thought I was crazy
or maybe I could be takin' it wrong and they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
see , you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringing up that Paul Wall's white
cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone , see , he's just aight
and Bubba Sparxxx , he just won't write
because he's so caught up in that snow white
that Timbaland can't even get him in the studio
he's so gone off that coke , right
and it's so sad , cause he's dope , right
America's next great white hope , right
so now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny ass white rapper show , right
and which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about
they said it'd be real , I'm just spillin' it out
there's somethin' about a white boy talking black and runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
and I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit
Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white and the best golfer's black
and I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack offa' that
but these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out
but I had already hit middle America
Parents had all got to likin' me now
when suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy
all of the hatred for me must've died
thought I committed career suicide so I had to turn back into the bad guy
so faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
and anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy
and Angelina Jolie is just another ho
and Brad is a sucka' because once I fuck her
she wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby
you know what I say No
You better save some of them kids from Madonna
she needs all the publicity she can get
you want a Shady Well , you got it , man
I ain't apologizin' for shit

I'm a goat
and I don't mean to gloat
but I know what I know and I know what you think
and these magazines'll never put it in ink
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and I consider myself one of those
so thank you very much , here it goes

Man , I'm takin' my ball and goin' home , man
shit is too easy
nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause

so don't worry , I'm out the motherfuckin' game
and y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best
but y'all know that

and like I said , I'm one of the motherfuckin' best
before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch
but before I go , I'd like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasn't there from the start
and thank you very much to everybody who was
and y'all ain't gotta say it , just think it
cause I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know


I'm out , y'all
it's been real , peace



I'm a little nutty and I know it
but if you go back and
take a look at my history
you will see that I'm
not the only one who's off his rocker
there were many before me 
I was always labelled
the black sheep of the family what a bad seed I
grow to be but if you take a look
at us now you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree


 alright , look
I'ma tell you the story
from my side maybe you'll understand check it out 
you done witnessed
unexplainable shit
too insane to explain
people run from what
the just don't get
maybe Shady shoulda
just hit 'em with a little bit
did I spit too soon
Should I of spoon fed 'em it
but I was just so eager
to prove I was even worth
being in the same
league or the room with of the people
of whom I was in every now and then I
look up like I was seeking approval
was it because of the
pigment of my skin
or was it a figment of
my imagination
maybe it bothered me
more than it did them
maybe it wasn't a big
deal back then
but to me it was , see
what it was was
I had developed the
complex from being judged
Proof spit his verse ,
now I'm next , let's see who
I'm in the booth
staring back to see who's mugs
I get a reaction from ,
usually the first thumb was from
Proof
and the rest of the
group backed him up
and no one lied to
each other cause none of us had deals
it was real , we just
wanted tickets for that meal


Sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree
I said 
sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree


Ever since my mother
was pregnant
with her second egg
cause she said
that I had a baby sister
who fell out of the window
I was too young to remember
Kansas City projects
I was like 5 , 6 , and how come
I remember Malcolm ,
Isaac , and Boogie
if it was the projects in Missouri
cause those're my best
friends until Isaac
took my tricycle and
my uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
and ended up getting
jumped and cut in the gut with a
switch and 70 - some stitches
which is still , to this day
why my mother still
tries to show me some old fake picture
of a fictitious little
sister who never existed and this is why part of
my life's so twisted
but I can never be as
sick as that bitch is
and , by the way , that
picture's one of my relatives

 
Sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree
I said 
sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree


You probably have to
peel back layers upon layers of
pain to see why everything
I say is so insane
what's different about my brain that separates me
from other players in this game on the surface , it may
seem like a scheme or some sort of scam
for me to get some damn sympathy
but that's the last thing
I need is for people
to walk around feeling
sorry for me 
and I'm not a G , never
claimed to be
I gave my vest to
Cashis ,
he'll need it more than me
but we'll see , cause we ain't lookin' for beef
but if it comes our
way , what do we , turn the other
cheek come on


Sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree
I said 
sometimes I feel like
it's just me

I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree

You feelin' blue , too late
Go smurf yourself you make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate


My life would be so much better , if you'd just drop dead
I was layin' in bed last night thinkin' and this thought just popped in my head
And I thought , wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead I would feel so much better


Think I just relapsed , this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway , tryin' to get some time alone and just think
Till the cops pulled me over but they let me go 'cause I told 'em I'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck hoe's , with a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias I hate all bitches the same , baby come on
Excuse the pun but bitch is such a 'broad' statement and I'm
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on
'Cause a woman broke my he - art I say he - art
'Cause she ripped it in two pa - arts and threw it in the garbage
Who you think you a - are bitch
Guess it's time for me to get the dust off and pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L word again
I lo - lo - lo - lo lesbian
Aaahhh I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life'd be so much better if you just




'Cause you told me you'd love me forever bitch that was a lie
Now I never wanted someone to die so bad in my fuckin' life
But fuck it there's other fish in the sea


And I'm a have a whale of a time being a single sailor
For the night , bitch on a scale a
One to ten shit I must be the holy grail of
Catches hoe I got an Oscar attached to my fuckin' name 
I might hit the club find a chick that's tailor
Made for me say fuck it kick some shots back git hammered and nail her
These bitches tryin' get attached but there failin' to latch onto the tail of
My bumper they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched , yeah I'm rich as a bitch
But bitches ain't shit I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me that's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swingin' at these chicks on - site
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's 'foul' but my dicks on 'strike'
So all that love shit is null and void , bitch I'm a droid
I avoid Cupid stupid wasn't for blow jobs you'd be unemployed
Oye , yoy - yoy
Man oh , man your boy - boy - boy's
Gettin' sick of these girls - girls - girls , oink oink oink
You fuckin' pigs all you're good for is doink doink doink
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of 'em , I need a machine gun
I'll take 'em all out , I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
Have a heart attack and just
Drop dead and I'm a throw a fuckin' party after this

Tell me where to go , tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say , no matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you


I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired Am I a martian
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
'Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffing at authority , defiant often
Flying off at the handle at my mom , no dad
So I am non - compliant at home , at school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding off in the corner somewhere quiet
Trying not to be noticed 'cause I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
'Cause he said that I eyeballed him

And if you fall , I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from all the wars that are fought
Inside your world
Please have faith in my words

'Cause this is my legacy , legacy , eh
This is my legacy , legacy , eh
There's no guarantee ,
It's not up to me ,
We can only see
This is my legacy , legacy
Legacy , legacy


I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come , it's mind boggling
'Cause I obsess on everything in my mind small shit
Bothers me but not my father , he said Sayonara then split
But I don't give a shit I'm fine long as
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing's the matter with me
Shit look on the bright side at least I ain't walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I
Find in the garbage , a frame , then put tires on it
Headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight , it's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'
They're kinda giving me confidence
Instead of tryna escape through my comics ,
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on that
I could be iconic , and my conquest
Is word to Phife Dawg from a tribe called Quest

This is my legacy , legacy , eh
This is my legacy , legacy , eh
There's no guarantee ,
It's not up to me ,
We can only see
This is my legacy , legacy
Legacy , legacy


I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from , and get inspired off em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch , I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
Me against the world so what I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
'Cause you dicks , butt kiss , a bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon' die a ball licker I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Suck a dick , the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me and I'm the Fire Marshall and this is my

Legacy , legacy , eh
This is my legacy , legacy , eh
There's no guarantee , it's not up to me , we can only see
This is my legacy , legacy
Legacy , legacy



Came to the world at a time when in was in need of a villain
An asshole , that role think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped to think that I was speakin to children
Everything was happenin' so fast it was like I blinked , sold 3 million
Then it all went blank , all I remember is feelin' ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I'm always under attack , man I coulda' stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really
Thinkin' if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit but since when did this many
People ever give a shit what I had to say it's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin' put a dick in your rear - end
That's why every time you mention a lyric
I thanked you for it , for drawin' more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform , I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect and battled for it
Mad awards , had GLAAD annoyed atta - boy
They told me to slow down , I'd just zone - out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blopde , it's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out
'Cause I was tryin to leave No Doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history think they know now
Because everybody knows


Everybody knows , that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go , people want to go home , everyone knows
Everybody knows , so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide , you are just an asshole
Everyone knows , everyone knows Thanks for the support , asshole 


Quit actin' salty , I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history , well God damn honky that compliment's like back - handin' a donkey , good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah , I'm off him , but what the fuck's all this trash talking about
The fight was fixed , I'm back and you can't stop me you knocked me down
I went down for the count , I fell but the fans caught me and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me to take my belt
Word to Pacquiao , momma said there ain't nothin else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out , or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion like Freddie Roach when he's quotin'
Shake - speare , so what if insults are revoltin'
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'till your bullet riddled , but you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess , gotta have a goddamn
Vest on your chest and a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs ta test a testicles Not that man
Half you don't got the guts , intestinal blockage , rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts in all those
Water bottles in Colorado , so get lost , Waldo my soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping
A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole , better pack toilet paper
But I'm takin' no crap hoe , here I go down the Bat Pole and I'm changing back into that ole maniac in fact there they go , tryin' to dip out the back door retreating
'Cause everybody knows




Holy mackerel I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth I smacked a girl
Off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed ICP in this bitch how do fuckin' magnets work '
'Cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable , hate to be dramatical but I'm not romantical
L'm makin' up words , so you can understandable
It's tragical , thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen , that ain't practical
You crackin'
A joke It's laughable
'Cause me and love's like a bad combination I keep them feelings locked in a vault , so it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded
Full body armor bitch , you just need a helmet 'cause if you think you special , you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a trainwreck , I gotta one track mind and shorty you're fine but you sorta remind me of a 49'er
'Cause you've been a gold digger since you was a miner
Been tryin' ta hunt me down like a dog 'cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
'Cause all of my spare time's spent
On my nose in this binder , so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters , but sometimes I rhyme
And it sounds like I forget I'm a father and I push it farther , so Father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been parent I'll never grow up , so to Hell with your parents and 'mother' fuck 'father' time
It ain't never gonna stop , a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half - dead , I'm half alive
Poured my half - empty glass in a cup now my cup has runneth over
And I'm about to set it on you like a muthafuckin' coaster
L'm goin' back to what got me here , yeah cocky and
Can't knock bein' Rudolph , so fear not my deer
And dry up your tear drops I'm here
White America's mirror , so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself , 'cause you're one too , shouldn't be a shock be
Cause everybody knows





Now this shit's about to kick off , this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip - hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up , everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra - ag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician , critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale , wait , that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham , ya bitch , shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim , bitch
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend , bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym , bitch


Kick your shoes off , let your hair down
 all night long
Grow your beard out , just weird out
 all night long


We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud , cause it's mayhem 'til the AM
So baby make just like K - Fed and let yourself go , let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody , everybody  , shake your body


Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed , ain't it
Khaki's pressed , Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced , so I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game , check mate
But girl , your body's banging , jump me in , dang , bang - bang
Yes siree , 'Bob' , I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock , Baw with da baw , dang - dang
Pow - pow , chica , pow , chica , wow - wow
Got your gal blowing up a valve , valve - valve
Ain't slowing it down , throw in the towel , towel - towel
Dumb it down , I don't know how , huh - huh , how - how
Least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so , now hoe




We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud , cause it's mayhem 'til the am
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go , let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody , everybody  shake your body




And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar , oh sorry yo , we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though , that's the past
But I done did enough Codeine to knock future into tomorrow
And girl , I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am trying to find a way to get you a - loan 
Oh , Marshall Mathers
Shit head with a potty mouth , get the bar of soap lathered
Kangols and car - heart - less cargos
Girl you're fixing to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd , ma'am , you birdbrain baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman , unless you're a swallow
Word , Rick word man you heard , but don't get discouraged girl
This is your jam , unless you got toe jam





Eminem Has a full line of chainsaws
Eminem Eminem Eminem Eminem Eminem Eminem
Marshall Mathers , Eminem , the rapper Eminem
Who can say fore sure
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science can operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Society will reap a great benefit


I walk around like a space cadet , place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer , case of Tourettes
Fuck fuck fuck can't take the stress
I make a mess , as the day progresses , angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up , bitches with these hedge trimmin' scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous it's
The only way to escape this mess and make the best of this situation , I guess
'Cause I feel like a little bitch , this predicament's
Despicable I'm sick of just getting' pushed it's ridiculous
I look like a freakin' wuss , a pussy this kid just took
My stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush , but I was six and shook
This fucker was twelve and was six foot with a vicious hook
He hit me I fell , I got back up all I did was book , now there's using your head
Mama always said


If you had a brain you'd be dangerous , a brain you'd be dangerous
I'm a prove you wrong
Mama , I'm a grow one day to be famous and I'm a be a pain in the anus
I'm a be the bomb
I'm a use my head as a weapon , find a way to escape this insaness
Mama always said , son , if you had a brain you'd be dangerous , guess it pays to be brainless


Fast forward some years later a teenager , this is fun , sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week , it's complete
It's usually once a month , this is some feat
I've accomplished they stomped me into the mud , gee for what reason You stumped me
But how do you get the shit beat outta you , beat down and be up beat , when you don't have nothing
No valid shot at life , chance to make it or succeed
'Cause you're doomed from the start , it's like you grew up on Jump Street from jump street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task
Practicin' trash talkin'
In a trance locked in my room , yeah but I got some plans , mama
These damn rhymes are failin' outta my pants pocket , I can't stop it
And I'm startin' to blend in more
In school this shit helps for sure , I'm gettin' more self assured then I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore , I done put a stop to that , threw my first punch -  end of story
Still in my skull's a vacant empty void been usin' it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory
In this gourde there's a Ford engine , door hinge , syringe , an orange an extension cord and a ninja sword
Not to mention four linchpins , an astringent stored
Ironin' board a bench , a wrench , a ore , wench an attention whore
Everything but a brain , but domes off the fuckin' chain like an independent store
Something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it , thank God that I don't , cause I'd probably be Dahmer , 'cause mama always said




Now my mom goes wahm - wahm - wahm
'Cause I'm not that smart , but I'm not dumb
I was on he bottom of the pile gettin' stomped
But somehow I came out on top



I told you one day , I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out , yo
I'm nice ya'II , fuck it , I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go they scream out go , I'm bout to clean house , yo
I'm Lysol , now I'm just household
Out sold the sell - outs , freak the hell out middle America , hear 'em yell out , in terror they were so scared and those kids
Just about , belted out whatever spouted or fell out my smart aleck mouth it was so weird
Inappropriate , so be it I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears it won't be as
Motherfukin , difficult yeah , 'til then hopefully ya
Little homos get over your fears and phobias
It's ok to be scared - straight they said I provoked queers
'Til emotions evoke tears , my whole career's
A stroke of sheer genius , smoke and mirrors tactical practical jokes , yeah
You motherfuckin' insert insult here
Who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ole' emcee'd
Be able to take the whole culture and re - upholstery it
And boy , they did flock , can't believe this little hick locked
This hip - hop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got
That white trash traffic in gridlock shit hoppin' like six blocks
From a Kid Rock Insane Clown Posse concert in mid October
And God forbid I see the Wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium , y'all cause
I'll turn into the Unabomber mama always said




Insaneness ain't even a word you stupid fuck
Neither is ain't



I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me , stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy , yeah , you think I'm crazy


I wanted the fame , but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh , well , guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public Excuse me
For wanting my cake and eat it too , and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew; see , but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink , used it as a tool when I blew steam 
Hit the lottery , oh wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep , two sheep
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
'Cause I'm


I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me , stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy , yeah , you think I'm crazy

Well , that's nothing
Well , that's nothing


Now , I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me
To seize the moment and don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjuring , sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from

Yoda - loda - le - hee - hoo
I think it went wandering off down yonder
And stumbled on 'ta Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conking me in the head
Keep knocking , nobody's home , I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
Don't shoot the messenger , I'm just friends with the


I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me , stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy , yeah , you think I'm crazy

Well , that's nothing
Well , that's nothing


Call me crazy but I have this vision
One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at
MC's , blood get spilled and I'll
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that
Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
To the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great
It's payback , Russell Wilson falling way back
In the draft , turn nothing into something , still can make that
Straw into gold chump , I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket , face facts
I am nuts for real , but I'm okay with that
It's nothing , I'm still friends with the


I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me , stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy , yeah , you think I'm crazy


Well , that's nothing
Well , that's nothing



I own a mansion but live in a house
A king size bed but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mister Bright Side , glass is half - full
But my tanks half - empty , gasket just blew


This always happens
Thirty minutes from home gotta lay a log cabin , only option I have's McDonalds' bathroom
In a public stall droppin' a football so every time someone walks in the John I get Maddened
Shady what up , what come on man I'm crappin'
And you're askin' for my goddamn autograph on a napkin
Oh , that's odd I just happened
To run out of tissue , yeah hand me that on second though I'd be glad then
Thanks dog , names Todd a big fan I
Wiped my ass with it , crumbled it up in a wad threw it back and
Told 'im Todd , you're the shit when's all of this crap end
Can't pump my gas without causin' an accident
Pump my gas , cut my grass , I can't take out the fuckin' trash
Without someone passin' through my sub harassin'
I'd count my blessings but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow than bask , suffering succotash , but the ant - 
Acid it gives my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fuckin' mashed
Potatoes , so what hoe kiss my country bumpkin ass
Missouri southern roots , what the fuck is upper class
Call lunch dinner , call dinner supper , Tupperware in the cupboard plastic ware up the ass
Stuck in the past iPod what the fuck is that
B - Boy to the core mule I'm as stubborn as


Maybe that's why It feels so strange
Got it all but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And , life's been good to me so far


They call me classless I heard that , I second and third that , don't know what the fuck I'd be doin' if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd sack
But I blew , never turned back
Turned forty and still sag , teenagers act more fuckin' mature jack
Fuck you gonna say to me I'll leave on my own terms ass
Hole I'm goin berserk , my nerves are bad
But I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people look at her , dag
Her nylons are ran , her skirts snagged and I heard she drag races  swag
Tuck in my Haynes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick  word skag
We'd be the perfect match , cause you're a vacuum , I'm a dirtbag
My apologies , no disrespect to technology , but what the heck's all of these buttons you expect me to sit here and learn that
Fuck I gotta do ta hear this new song from Luda , be an expert at
Computers I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica hell with
Playstation , I'm still on my first man on some Zelda
Nintendo bitch run , jump , punch , stab , and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti put it on bread make a sandwich with Welch's
And belch , they say this spray butter's bad for my health , but
I think this poor white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett , Fred Sanford and welfare , mentality helps ta
Keep me grounded , that's why I never take full advantage of wealth
I managed to dwell within these parameters still crammin' the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
I can't even help it , this is the hand I was dealt a
Creature of habit , feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves , God damn it to hell I
Can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere , I get so mad I could yell the
Other day someone got all elaborate and stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King , they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma's catching up with me




Got friends on Facebook , all over the world
Not sure what that means , they tell me it's good
So I'm artist of the decade , I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up but the frame is all cracked


I'm tryin' ta be low - key , hopefully nobody notices me
In produce , hunched over , giant nose bleed
Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle , by the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed , I just did Comerica with Hova the shows over , I'm hidin' in Kroger's buyin' groceries
He just had front row seats told me , sign his poster then insults me
Wow up close didn't know you had crows feet
I'm at a crossroads , lost , still shopping at Costco's
Sloppy joe's bulk waffles
Got caught pickin' my nose  look over see these two hot hoes
Finger still up one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em , stuck at the light the fuckin' shit's
Takin' forever to change , it's stuck these bitches are lovin' it
Rubbin' it in , chucklin'
Couldn't do nothin' play it off what you bumpin' Trunk Muzik , Yelawolf's better , fuckin' bitch
They want me to flip at the label , but I won't succumb to it
The pressure , they want me to follow up with a
Nother one after Recovery was so highly coveted
But what good is a fuckin' Recovery if I fumble it
Cause I'm a drop the ball if I don't get a grip , hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivision
To fuck with bitch , quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids I love my city
But you pushed me to the limit what a pity
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky , and it's rainin' out
Kool - Aid stain on the couch , I'll never get it out
But bitch , I got an elevator in my house , ants and a mouse
I'm livin' the dream





Something's burnin' I can't figure out what
 it's either lust , or a cloud of dust , judgment is clouded must
Just be the powder from the power of
 but I'm in somethin' I don't know how ta get outta
Left my girl in the house alone , is that my 'soon to be spouse's' moan and the further I walk the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard , 'cause after all this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt I
Think I might be about ta busta , bust her , the thought's scary yo , though and it hurts - brace
Hope it ain't here we go , yo 'cause my head already goes to worst case scenario , though in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory though , should of known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date , could of made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face
First no  you don't  under  stand  I  don't  do  this for anyone ever  -  yeah , that ain't what they all say
I'll say , you can suck a softball through a straw , used to be my fiance , till you sucked on Wayne , Andre and Kanye , Labron , Akon , Jay , Lil' Jon , Raekwon , Mase , Polow da Don , Dre
Dante Ross , James Conway , Kwame
Guess I'm gettin' my g - God dang Jigga on , eh
'Cause your name I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it I'm movin' on , you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin'
The game of love , love , love , love , la - la - la - la - la love


She doesn't love me , no she don't love me no more
She hates my company , guess she don't love me no more , I tried to get her up out of my head , left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me , like she never did before
And I told her: go where you wanna go , go do what 'cha wanna , I don't care
And I told her: go where you wanna go , go do what 'cha wanna , I don't care
I told that bitch


I'm a sucker for love you , a sucker for dick
Suckih' dick in your mama tub , then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck unda' the water he drowned , like an abortion , they booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya'
'Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone'
And Kendrick don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels ya little fuckin' ferris wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me , fuck ya think we're gonna get married still
Fucking Mary had a little lamb this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy God mama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day ' bitch you serious
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face , curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me , you cut me deep as a cesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin , I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' 'im
His mouth piece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial , yeah I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like , ain't it what about if I was as famous
As Marshall , would you give fellatio in the carpool
Cops pull us over , they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin' I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile ya chasing her
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her , pity the fool and pity the fool in me I'm a live with the
Game of love , love , love , love , la - la - la - la - la love




So needless to say , I'm feelin' betrayed , snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off 'Wee - Bey' from the Wire's dick now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliche , it's all my fault anyway she's turnin' the tables , I'm a beat - break
She treats my face like Serato , she cuts and scratches like a deejay , each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display , is symptomatic of attack behave
Ior , back together , but forgot today was her B - Day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstandin' but just as I went to slam on the brakes , that's when I realized that she may be crazy as me , wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brake line , stepped on them fuckers eight times , still goin' 73 thank
God there's an exit comin' up , what the mother F - U - cock's
Wrong with her , hit the off - ramp , 'til I coasted to a God damn halt , hit a fucking tree now here she comes at full speed she's racing at me , OK , you wanna fuck with me 'eh
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window she's screamin' I body slam her on the cement until the concrete gave
And created a sink hole , buried the stink hoe in it , then paid to have the street repaved
Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray , durin' a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though , cause she's layin' next to me in bed
Directly aimin' a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up like fuck it , I've had it I'm checkin' into rehab
I confess I'm a static addict I guess
That's why I'm so clingy every girl I've ever had either says
I got too much baggage or I'm too fuckin' dramatic , man what the fuck is the matter I'm just
A fuckin' romantic , I fuckin' love you , you fuckin' bitch combative , possessive , in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said hit the road , then after she left I sent that bitch a text
That said be careful driving don't read this and have an accident  , she glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad , thought we had a connect -  no sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case , than the model covered in L'oreal and Mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories , for story telling , while the whore was yelling rape
Till her vocal chords were swelling and her voice was more horser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates
Of my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
Less your Andrea Yates , don't ask me for a date though you're late , well , the sentiment's great
But wait , think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date , I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly cause of the game of
 wait , dinner at eight
I have infinite hate in my blood
And it's mainly cause of the game of love


Love , love , love
La - la - la - la - la love



Mom , I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off , and I'm fucked up
And , Mom , I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink , yeah


I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far


I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt , in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it , but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far
Cleaning Out My Closet and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause , Ma ,
You're still beautiful to me , 'cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm , our house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to Chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But , agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve 
Ma , let me grab my fucking coat , anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats
Especially when dad , he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat , you'd think that it'd make us close 
Further away it drove us , but together headlights shine , a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go , back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house , the oldest , so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old ,
And that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though , but




'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow
But I'm sorry , Mama , for Cleaning Out My Closet , at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so , never meant that far to take it though ,
'cause now I know it's not your fault , and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own ,
But now the medications taken over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry , the shit is painful though
But , Ma , I forgive you , so does Nathan , yo
All you did , all you said , you did your best to raise us both
Foster care , that cross you bear , few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you , Debbie Mathers , oh , what a tangled web we have ,
'cause one thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it , I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress , every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa , kidnap them
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me , her and Nate , we introduced you , hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths ,
And I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So , Mom , please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest ,
I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt , I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming , I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
'Cause you're my Ma




I want a new life 
One without a cause 
So I'm coming home tonight 
Well , no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well , just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh , even if there's songs to sing
Well , my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I never say , Goodbye , cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die



I want a new life



Roll over and go to reach for you , you're gone
This bed's empty without you
You said you're moving on
But I'm having some trouble getting there
But dwelling ain't getting me , uhh , anywhere
Fuckin' Valentine's Day
Fuck February , stuffed teddy bear , guts everywhere
Machete on the floor I smashed up every mirror
Yeah , how do I look
You fuckin' just let me here to , die didn't you
Why didn't you respond yet
I've written you five or six different times and
I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apolo - gizing to you
I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
This couldn't be true , we can't be over
So violets are blue , roses are red
Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you


Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said , honey , I'm back
Just so you don't die alone , just so you don't die alone


Guess I gotta deal with the fact that , you ain't never comin' back
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you
So I'm findin' something the matter with them
Excuse to not see anyone
Useless , rather pick up the phone , not at all , followin' protocol
I get bowled like bowling balls
No balls and go to call to talk , forget what I want to say
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman
I'm sick of playin' these games , I can't handle this heartbreak
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
Like birthday cake candles
Hang up the phone and I shake , I think I may have made a mistake
Can't escape the madness
Turn the radio on , I hate this sad song
But I can't even change the station
The same one's playin' on eight channels
I lay awake in shambles I'm startin to hallucinate
I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I


Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said , honey , I'm back
Just so you don't die alone , just so you don't die alone

Give me one more , bottle for the pain
Give me one more for the memories
Give me one more , I'll make it taste like a steak
It'll help alleviate
It'll soothe this ache
Of trying to fake
That she's really , she's really coming back


And it's been a while now , but I finally realize how
Much reality sucks , but it's just something about our love
I'm still in denial now , dealing with the finality of it
And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we , spent
And how I'll never hold you again
Ain't shit I can do about it
Now my head is overcrowded
With these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it
And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
Knowing what you done did to me , huh
Did it even occur to you that I loved you
Completely , deep and madly , head over heels for you
Was you and me , once used to be together forever
It was supposed to be us , but you crushed the dream
We was supposed to die together , and it's killing me so much
When I sleep I wake up dead , must be why I


Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said , honey , I'm back
Just so you don't die alone , just so you don't die alone



Feels like a close , it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I , thing I know


Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same , old song
Ever since I came a long
From the day the song called Hi , my Name Is dropped
Started thinkin' my name was fault
Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the , equivalent of a modern - day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment , dog
Gangsta Nah , courageous balls
Had to change my style , they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ & Nas , out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game I pondered
I just wanna' play my part , should I make waves or not
So back and forth in my brain , the tug - o - war wages on
I don't wanna' seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta' take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
Keep pluggin' , it's your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they're gonna' talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it , ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme
What I really wanna' say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet 'cha feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid ta'


I was a afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna' go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear 
Guts over fear 
For all the times I let you push me round
And let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear , guts over fear


Feels like a close , it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I , thing I know


I know what it's like , I was there once , single parents
Hate your appearance , did you struggle to find your place in this world
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark , started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit , but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same , old song
But I'd rather make Not Afraid 2 than make another motherfucking We Made You , uh
And I don't wanna' seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise , pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use that'll make ya' strong
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just havin' to balance my dang self
When on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you , ma , 'cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady - mania ,
So when they empty that stadium
'Least I made it out ta that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her , anyone similar , you are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward , just let them a - holes talk ,
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fuckin' faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
And to think I was a


I was a afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way o - o - out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear 
Guts over fear 
For all the times I let you push me round
And let you keep me down
Now I got , guts over fear , guts over fear



Another day , another hotel , the inside of it's nice though
Oh well , this is my life so
As I go and try to close for the night's show
See how far that line goes
Still blows my mind show
Business guess I'll just never get
So this shit just always feels so weird
To this day because all I ever did
Was just say the shit I wouldve wanted to hear
Other people say to me when I was a kid
So please don't make me some type of hero
Cause I will say some inspirational shit in a real way
But still will have a field day with some of the
Fucked up shit in the world and tell it to suck the dick
Cause I still make fun of a sit
Someone's in like a son of a bitch
At another's expense , I'm fuckin' relentless
As fuck when it comes to this pen
I struggle with coming to my senses
Stuck on the fence on a balance beam if I seem unbalanced
It's challenging but my conscience allows me to think
The most foulish childish things without even blinking
Without even thinkin' about , all the stinkin' amounts of people that seem to be reachin' in the crowds
I'm scream in the palace , sold out this evening
But now it's , lay me down to sleeping
Is it really my soul to keep or
Have I sold it cheap is it greed
Do I take more than I need
When I joke about leavin'
But keep over achievin'
Because what's stolen from me barely broke even

It's a fine , fine line
It's a fine , fine line

So I notice how I paint myself
And through my hair when ordeals I'm so vain
I want my respect but ignore the
Butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
Till I , sit in the dark and I reflect
And my reflection shows what it's like here
Cause this vanity , surrounded by all these lights yeah
It's like a nightmare
I said , this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare
And I don't like how I see myself so I
Open the Bible to Isaiah cause
I swear to Christ there are nights where
I stay up at night just to say a prayer twice
Just to make sure God hears cause this ice layer
Ice skate on the nice way
Puting it but I like staying
Feistier then a triceritops and like a dice player
I got a nice pair of dice here
Sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit
From in this house it's quite bare , but it ain't when you can't leave it
And I feel so isolated , nice I made it
But it's like I payed the price of fame twice I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song , it's a cycle ain't it
Then I wonder why I stay famous
Keep walkin' the line
This gold fish poke gets old
But especially when you don't know
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
You don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier
Or if you sold your soul

It's a fine , fine line
It's a fine , fine line

And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back , to me

I still remember the times when
They were , simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were , when I was just killin' the mics
I'll never forget what that feeling was like I ,
Miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a dime and , now I'm diamond
Can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Stuck in this house hibernatin'
Hate even going outside it
Sucks , sometimes I just wanna walk in Target and look at shit Browse , I don't even want to buy nothin'
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
Look how excited , I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
Everything about it I miss
Which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow , I must have had Alzheimers
Long time since I shouted them out , bout time
Cause it's been on my mind lately how
Zee you always supported me
You vouched , I will never forget that and
How you guys , accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too , you slept on my couch
And I been thinkin' bout the time I slept on the floor at the outhouse
Rhyming is all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside I'll always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I

It's a fine , fine line
It's a fine , fine line
