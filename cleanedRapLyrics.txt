oh yeah this is eminem baby back up in that motherfucking ass
one time for your motherfucking mind we represent the 313
you know what i'm saying
'cause they don't know shit about this
for the 9 - 6
ayo my pen and paper 'cause a chain reaction
to get your brain relaxing a zany acting maniac in action
a brainiac in fact son you mainly lack attraction
you look insanely whack when just a fraction of my tracks run
my rhyming skills got you climbing hills
i travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
i'm sliming grills of roaches with sprayed on disinfectants
twist the necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
put this in decks and check the monologue turn your system up
twist them up and indulge in the marijuana smoke
this is the season for noise pollution contamination
examination of more cartoons than animation
my lamination of narration
hit's a snare and bass in a track fucked up rapper interrogation
when i declare invasion there aingt no time to be stare and gazing
i turn the stage into a barren wasteland
i'm infinite
you heard of hell well i was sent from it
i went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
now i'm trying to repent from it
but when i hear the beat i'm tempted to make another attempt at it
bust it i let the beat commence so i can beat the sense in your elite defense
i got some meat to mince a crew to stomp and two feet to rinse
i greet the gents and ladies i spoil loyal fans
i foil yo plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
my coil hands around this microphone are lethal
one thought in my cerebral is deeper then a jeep full of people
mcs are feeble i came to 'cause some pandemonium
battle a band of phony mcs and stand the lonely one
imitator intimidator stimulator simulator of data eliminator
there's never been a greater since the burial of jesus
fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
my thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
my accapella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis
and eases you mentally gently sentimentally instrumentally
with entity dementedly meant to be infinite
man i got evidence i'm never dense and i been clever ever since
my residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the m - o
so i'm assuming all responsibility
'cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill mcs
mic messaler slamming like a wrestler
here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
no one is specialer my skill is intergalactical
i get cynical act a fool then i send a crew back to school
i never packed a tool or acted cool it wasn't practical
i'd rather let a tactical tactful track tickle your fancy
in fact i can't see or can't imagine
a man who aingt a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
so this is for my family the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
plus the man who never had a plan b
be all you can be 'cause once you make an instant hit
i'm tensed a bit and tempted when i see the sins my friends commit
yeah soul intent checking it number one baby this week
this is mc proof
and dj head
checking in on wego
ay yo we got the number one requested song of the day coming up next

and it's called it's ok
 check it out 
 hey kyu
it's a broke day but everything is ok 
i'm up all night but everything is alright 
it's a rough week and i don't get enough sleep 
it's a long year pretending i belong here 
one day i plan to be a family man happily married
i wanna grow to be so old that i have to be carried
till i'm glad to be buried 
and leave this crazy world
and have at least a half a million for my baby girl
it may be early to be planning this stuff
cause i'm still struggling hard to be the man and it's tough
cause man it's been rough but still i manage enough
i've been taken advantage of damaged and scuffed
my hands have been cuffed
but i don't panic and huff frantic and puff
or plan to give up the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
i'm anteing up double or nothing i've been trouble enough
and i'm sick of struggling and suffering see
my destiny's to rest at ease till i'm impressed and pleased
with my progress i won't settle for less than cheese
i'm on a quest to seize all my own label to call
way before my baby is able to crawl
i'm too stable to fall the pressure motivates
to know i hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
i seen the golden gates to heaven on earth
where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf q
i'm going for broke gambling and playing for keeps
everyday in the streets scrambling and paying for cheep 
praying for sleep
dreaming with a watering mouth
wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
in this slaughtering house caught up in bouts
with the root of all evil
i've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
and make them do shit illegal
for these grant's and jackson's
these transactions explain a man's actions
but in the mist of this insanity i found my christianity 
through god and there's a wish he granted me
he showed me how to cope with the stress
and hope for the best instead of mope and depressed
always groping a mess of flying over the nest
to selling dope with the rest
i quit smoking cess to open my chest
life is stressful inside this cesspool 
trying to wrestle i almost bust a blood vessel
my little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
he's asthmatic running home from school away from crack addicts
kids attract static children with automatics
taking target practice on teens for starter jackets
i'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
i won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
it's cumbersome i'm trying to do well on this earth
but it's been hell on this earth since i fell on this earth
uh it's ok yeah it's alright even though i can't sleep
uh yeah it's ok it's alright i can't sleep

caped crusader taking care of undeserving lime lighters

experimentally i found a way to spread interamentally
when i stumbled upon this resolution
by using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution

with the agility to escape a killer bee colony
so get your cameras and capture how miraculous 
i rap for all you draculas and showed you all how whack you was
i meant it as a dis cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this

without you adding fuel to the fire
i'm cruel to the liar
who fails to recognize my reign of hell rule to the sire
clinical studies show that i'm cynical
there's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
i'm sure the party people can agree
that i'm enchanting with the romantic
freaking the vocals so frantically
so throw your hands up in the atmosphere
and let them know the only party that was phat was here just be like
maxine

i know this crack fiend maxine who needs a vaccine
she tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
plus she got a sugar daddy
asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
if you mistook her sadly on her reputation
you're in jepordation if you aingt got no preparation
when you step away son she got her face done
looking provocative she'll let you knock it if
you press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
if you match the price otherwise she won't look at you twice
but when you catch the lice or get the urgency
to go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
don't bring your germs to me cause i aingt trying to hear it
while your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it 
sometimes i wonder what's your purpose in life that is
to get with every brother and unveil one of his kids shit
you living trife got three kids at home and club hopping every night
you say it's gonna stop but it just slows down
and then speeds back to a regular pace there is no end to this 
mystery whatever your reason even is to be
you say you wanna be with me but how can you say that
when you got niggas hiding in your closet
i refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely
i met this girl last week she was a freak and she liked me

and chilled on the side and then watched they niggas

she didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom

i'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
missing what i remember kissing and hugging and squeezing
bugging and weezing i'm having trouble when breathing
it's even tougher when sleeping
but there's a couple of reasons that i'm suffering and grieving
for loving and leaving you all i'm thinking of in the evening
you got my knees buckling and weakening
thoughts of nothing but freaking that i'm struggling to keep in
and interrupt when i'm speaking
i got some game that i'm preparing to run
the way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun
you got your hair in a bun no matter what you're wearing you stun
cause your comparing to none i wanna share in the fun
i feel a passionate lust when i'm imagining just us alone at last with a 
touch 
i see you grasping to trust but my intentions are good
the seed is passing in dust
i'm not asking to rush and answer immediately
i just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
if you agree to repeat after me i love you 
cause i just need you to see how much i'm eager to be
your man legally wed your love's keeping me fed
this is easily said so you can lead or be led
if you care to be down cause aingt nobody like you no where to be found
baby it's all on you it's you i call on boo
let's set a day up so you can fall on through
we'll take a spin in a lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es
we'll start it out with caviar don parigne
and then when it's a fact we are warm carry on
we'll take it slow see nobody will hurry things
i got the herbs the bacardi and hurricane
if daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
it's still all right cause i got minute maid and tangeray
your an incredible one that's rare in bed with edible underwear
you look impeccable nothing compares
i dream of freaking you the women that will speak it too so
it seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
now we all set to play only thing left to say is
when you step away baby but don't forget the neglicie
attention all units attention all units
we have an all points bulletin out on a man with green hair
i repeat we have an apb on a man with green hair
he's armed with a knife i repeat he's armed with a knife
proceed with caution watch your back fella's
he could be coming at your girlfriend next
there's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
his face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
he'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
he's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
ring the alarm look for a man with green hair
check at your girl's house he was last seen there
he's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks
i make you think you're a backstabber
why i oughtta
hit a bitch snake from the back i make you think you're a backstabber
stay away from him he aingt no good
we got the walkie - talkies to keep us all informed
suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
our unit storms in we split the ghetto in sectors
locking down every block and put up metal detectors
protectors and be sure that you stand close
watch each others backs and guard your command post
and most of all be advised that he's wise
he could be disguised as one of your very own guys
i'm on a solo mission to find him personally
to settle the score and beat then him mercifully
for what he first did to me
it's sure to be the last
following footprints with a magnifying glass
to drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
i'm mad as hell on the trail of the tattle tail
i heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
give me your girlfriend or i'm gonna kill ya
i followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
sneezing at dust and swinging at the spider - webs
inside the depths of his basement
i taste lint in my mouth then the lights in the place went
i saw my life flash in front of my eyes
i felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
none of my guys knew where i'm at i was doomed
then i remembered the flashlight in my costume
dealing with backstabber's there was one thing i learned
they're only powerful when you got your back turned
i yearned for the day that we finally met again
so i can give him a taste of his own medicine
he shed his skin then he promised to come clean
i took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
beating him over the head with the telephone
attention all cars attention all cars
unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
he's going back to the crazy home i repeat
he's going back to the crazy home how about that
jealous 
jealous what he mean jealous know what i'm saying
he just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes know what i'm saying
girls don't buy him no clothes he bought that ho some clothes
he don't buy me no clothes nigga aingt got no money no vibe no dick
i mean what do i got to be jealous for
he aingt gonna make it no where he aingt got no type of time
he has no career move i mean
i come home every single day from working double shifts
and stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
i come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
again you frisk me for numbers trying to bust me
it must be only just because you never learned to trust me
plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues
to many tissues for my feelings you misuse
i buy you jewelry you make a fool of me
i bring you diamond rings you say i'm bad at timing things
so what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
you act to be this gangsta bitch that aingt what first attracted me
i used to love your company now you always bugging me 
for information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
so i'ma wait for your evacuation
cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
see i've never been so sure and your just insecure
so my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
i recommend you take your things and check them in

and tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents

illiterate illigitimate shit spitter
bitch getter hid in the bush like margot kidder

but i was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
so what i'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage

delinquent toking microphones with broken english

it was predicted by a medic
i'd grow to be an addicted diabetic
living off liquid triametic

setup by these white blue collared hicks
just to make a dollar off of black music
with a subliminal ball of tricks
but those can kiss ass and swallow dicks
life by marshall mathers
what is life
life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
and everytime you think you gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
what are friends
friends are people that you think are your friends
but they really your enemies with secret indentities
and disguises to hide they true colors
so just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you aingt lookin
what is money
money is what makes a man act funny
money is the root of all evil
money'll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down

robbing armored trucks

i want the whole pie i won't be denied nathan
maybe i need my head inside straightened
brain contemplating clean out the register
dip before somebody catches ya
or gets ya description an' sketches ya
the connection was the prime suspect
but i aingt set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
cuz i got a daughter to feed
and 200 aingt enough to water the seed
the best thing would be for me to leave taco bell an' hit up chess king
and have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back stepped in waving the mac
cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
this bitch tried escaping the jack
grabbed her by the throat it's murder she wrote
you barely heard a word as she choked
it wasn't nutting for her to be smoked
but i slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
just then the pigs bust in yelling freeze
but i'm already wanted for selling keys
and bunch of other felonies from a to z like spelling bees
so before i dropped to the ground and fell on knees
i bust shots they bust back
hit the square in the chest he wasn't wearing a vest
left the house pulling out the drive backing out
need a backing out this lady's jag started blacking out

stole her car made a profit
grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
like the girl on set it off did
jetted off kid stole the whip now i'm a criminal
drove in thru somebody's yard dove into they swimming pool
climbed out and collapsed on the patio
i made it out alive but i'm injured badly though
parents screaming: son go in and call the police
tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace
tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
acting like they never seen nobody hit a nick before
smashed the window grabbed the nintendo 64
when they sell out in stores the price triples
i ran up the block jumping kids on tricycles
and colliding with an 80 - year old lady with groceries
there goes the cheese eggs milk and post toasties
stood up and started to see stars
too many siren sounds it seemed like a thousand police cars
barely escaped must - a been some dumb luck
jumped up and climbed the back of a moving dump truck
but i think somebody seen me maybe
plus i lost the damn nintendo and i must - a dropped the beanie baby
fuck it i give up i'm surrounded in blue suits
came out with a white flag hollering truce truce

and borrow a damn dress and one of her blonde wigs

a neck with bolts nurse we're losin him check the pulse
a kid who refused to respect adults
wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
a corny lookin white boy scrawny and always ornery
cause i was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on me
and i might snap one day just like that
i decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
 my first day in junior high this kid said
it's you and i three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die
i looked at my watch it was one twenty
i already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me
he said don't try to run from me you'll just make it worse
my palms were sweaty and i started to shake at first
something told me try to fake a stomach ache it works
i screamed owww my appendix feels like they could burst
teacher teacher quick i need a naked nurse

 nah that bully wants to beat your ass and i'ma let him
brain damage ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on
they say i never knew which way i was goin
but everywhere i go they keep playin my song
brain damage
way before my baby daughter hailey
i was harassed daily by this fat kid named d'angelo bailey
an eighth grader who acted obnoxious cause his father boxes
so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
one day he came in the bathroom while i was pissin
and had me in the position to beat me into submission
he banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose
soaked my clothes in blood grabbed me and choked my throat
i tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
but he just wouldn't leave he kept chokin me and i couldn't breathe
he looked at me and said you gonna die honkey
the principal walked in 
and started helpin him stomp me
i made them think they beat me to death
holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
then i got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
grabbed some sharp objects brooms and foreign tools
this is for every time you took my orange juice
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
i'm gettin you back bully now once and for good
i cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as i could
and beat him over the head with it til i broke the wood
knocked him down stood on his chest with one foot
 made it home later that same day
started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray
i couldn't even see what i was tryin to read
i went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
my mother started screamin what are you on drugs
look at you you're gettin blood all over my rug 
she beat me over the head with the remote control
opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
i picked it up and screamed look bitch what have you done
 oh my god i'm sorry son
 shut up you cunt i said fuck it
took it and stuck it back up in my head
then i sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck
it's brain damage
i got brain damage
it's probably brain damage

hilary clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
i ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbet 
my nerves hurt and lately i'm on edge

follow me and do exactly what the song says
smoke weed take pills drop out of school kill people
and drink jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
i'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
so i'm dumb enough to ask for a date with lauryn hill
some people only see that i'm white ignoring skill
cause i stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
but i don't get pissed y'all don't even see through the mist
how the fuck can i be white i don't even exist

a premature birth that was four minutes late
mother are you there i love you

and yell out loud all y'all get the hell out now

i'm bored out of my gourd  -  -  so i took a hammer 
and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my ford
guess i'm just a sick sick bastard
who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket 
one excederin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
i feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
 and if you ever see a video for this shit
i'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
got bitches on my jock out in east detroit
cause they think that i'm a motherfuckin beastie boy 
so i told em i was mike d
they was like gee i don't know he might be
i told em meet me at kid rock's next concert
i'll be standin by the loch ness monster  peace out 
then i jetted to the weed house
smoked out til i started bustin freestyles
broke out then i dipped quick back to the crib put on lipstick
crushed up the tylenol and ate it with a dipstick 
but it's the evil that made me this backstabbing deceitful and shady
i want the money the women the fortune and the fame
that means i'll end up burning in hell scorching in flames
that means i'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name
there's lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'cause right now i feel like i've just hit the rock bottom
i got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em 
i'm screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot 'em
holding two glocks i hope your doors got new locks on 'em
my daughter's feet aingt got no shoes or socks on 'em
and the rings you're wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em
and while you flaunt 'em i could be taking them to shops to pawn them
i got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em
'cause i never went gold off one song
i'm running up on someone's lawn with guns drawn
 skylar montgomery
 what do you want from me roger
 i know it was you all along messing around with my dear veronica
 wait a minute you hold it right there

 we were destined to be together
i met her on the beach
 are you out to destroy me
 no roger that's not what i want to do
i love her and were going to be together
 never
i don't know why this world keep turning
round and round
but i wish it would stop and let me off right now
yes man
as the world turns
we all experience things in life
trials and tribulations
that we all must go through
when someone wants to test us
when someone tries our patience
i hang with a bunch of hippies
and wacky tobacco planters
who swallow lit roaches
and light up like jack - o - lanterns
outsiders baby and we suing the courts
cause we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
they never should've booted me out of reform school
deformed fooltaking a shit in a warm pool
they threw me out the ramada inn
i said it wasn't me i got a twin 
it all started when my mother took my bike away
cause i murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
after that it was straight to the 40 ouncers
slappin teachers and jacking off in front of my counselors
class clown freshman dressed like les nessman
fuck the next lesson i'll past the test guessing
and all the other kids said eminem's a dishead
he'll never last the only class he'll pass is phys ed
may be true till i told this bitch in gym class
that she was too fat to swim laps she needed slim fast 
yeah bitch you so big you walked into big tanny's and stepped on jenny craig
she picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
put me in the headlock then i thought of my guinea pig
i felt the evilness and started transforming 
it began storming i heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
grabbed that bitch by her hair
drag her across the ground
and took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
sorry coach its too late to tell me stop
while i drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop
these are the days of our lives
these are the things that we must go through
day by day
we drive around in million dollar sports cars
while little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
outsiders and we suing the courts
cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
hypochondriac hanging out at the laundromat
where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
dressed like a sailor standing by a pale of garbage
its almost dark and i'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch
i met a slut and said what up its nice to meet ya
i'd like to treat ya to a faygo and a slice of pizza
but i'm broke as fuck and i don't get paid till the first of next month
but if you care to join me i was bout to roll this next blunt
but i aingt got no weed no phillies or no papers
plus i'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
so gimme all your money
and don't try nothing funny
cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me
i went to grab my gun
that's when her ass put it on me
wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
i fell through the glass doors
started causing a scene
then slid across the floor and flew right into a washing machine
jumped up with a broken back
thank god i was smocking crack all day
and doped up off coke and smack
all i wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
now i wanna kill her
but so i gotta catch her first
ran through rally's parkin lot and took a shortcut
saw the house she ran up in
and shot her fucking porch up
kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
looked around the room
that's when i seen the bedroom door shut
i know you're in there bitch i got my gun cocked
you might as well come out now
she said come in its unlocked
i walked in and all i smelled was liz claiborne
and seen her spread across the bed naked watching gay porn
she said come her big boy lets get acquainted
i turned around to run twisted my ankle and sprained it
she came at me at full speed nothing could stop her
i shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
i started to beg no please let go
but she swallowed my fucking leg whole like an egg roll
with one leg left now i'm hoppin around crippled
i grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
just trying to buy me some time then i remembered this magic trick
den den den den den den go go gadget dick
whipped that shit out and aingt no doubt about it
it hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
i shouted now bitch lets see who gets the best
stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death 
come here bitch
come here
take this motherfucking dick
bitch come here
and as we go along
throughout the days of our lives
we all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
that we must go through
these are the things that surround us through our atmosphere
every day
every single day the world keeps turning
who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough 
told you how to slap dicks and murder your girl 
gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
sold a billion tapes and still screamed fuck the world
 so come and kill me while my name's hot
and shoot me twenty - five times in the same spot 
i think i got a generation brainwashed
to pop pills and smoke pot til they brains rot 
stop they blood flow until they veins clot
i need a pain shot and a shot of plain scotch
purple haze and acid raindrops
spike the punch at the party and drink pop 
shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
bad boy i told you that i can't stop
you gotta make em fear you 'fore you make em feel you
so everybody buy my shit or i'ma come and kill you
i got mushrooms i got acid i got tabs and aspirin tablets
i'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
you know me i'm your friend when you need a minithin
 i'm shady
i like happy things i'm really calm and peaceful 
i like birds bees i like people
i like funny things that make me happy and gleeful 
like when my teacher sucked my wee - wee in preschool 
the ill type i stab myself with a steel spike
while i blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
cause this is how i am in real life 
i don't want to just die a normal death i wanna be killed twice 
how you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat
when they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet 
so bring the money by tonight  -  cause your wife 
said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life 
i try to keep it positive and play it cool
shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school 
cause i'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
tonight i think i'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter
yo i listen to your demo tape and act like i don't like it 
six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit 
people don't buy shit no more they just dub it
that's why i'm still broke and had the number one club hit 
but they love it when you make your business public
so fuck it i've got herpes while we on the subject 
and if i told you i had aids y'all would play it
cause you stupid motherfuckers think i'm playin when i say it
 -  -  well i do take pills don't do speed
don't do crack  don't do coke i do smoke weed 
don't do smack i do do shrooms do drink beer 
i just wanna make a few things clear
my baby mama's not dead  she's still alive and bitchin 
and i don't have herpes my dick's just itchin
it's not syphilis and as for being aids infested
i don't know yet i'm too scared to get tested
 i told you i was shady
y'all didn't wanna believe me
i'm shady
 and that's my name
i reckon you aingt familiar with these here parts
you know there's a story behind that there saloon
twenty years ago two outlaws took this whole town over
sheriffs couldn't stop 'em
quickest damn gun - slingers i've ever seen
got murdered in cold - blood
that old saloon there was their little home away from home
they say the ghosts of bad and evil still live in that tavern
and on a quiet night
you can still hear the footsteps of slim shady and royce da 5'9
i don't speak i float in the air wrapped in a sheet
i'm not a real person i'm a ghost trapped in a beat
i translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
and a noise is spread picked up and transmitted through royce's head
trap him in his room possess him and hoist his bed
til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
told him each one of his boys is dead
i asked him to come to the dark side
he made a choice and said
who hard yo i done heard worse
we can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
to see which one'll swerve first
two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds
that of a globe on top of nine other planets
kissed the cheek of the devil
intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto
dismissal i'm not a fair man
disgraced the race of an atheist
intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
one track sliced without swords
i buried the christ corpse
in my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
and stay over - worked it's like the nazis and the nation
collaborating attempting to take over the earth
cause this is what happens when bad meets evil
and we hit the trees til we look like vietnamese people
he's evil and i'm bad like steve seagal
above the law cause i don't agree with police either 
we aingt eager to be legal
so please leave me with the keys to your jeep eagle
i breathe ether in three lethal amounts
while i stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
releasing rage on anybody in squeezing range
cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
no i'm not i just want to shoot up and i'm pissed off
cause i can't find a decent vein
the disaster with dreads
i'm bad enough to commit suicide
and survive long enough to kill my soul after i'm dead
when in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
cause i serve any stranger with money
i spray a hundred man until they joint chains
while slipping bullets at point - blank range like they was punches
piss on a flag and burn it murder you then come to your funeral
service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
whipping human ass throwing blows cracking jaws
with my fists wrapped in gauze dipped in glue and glass
i'm blazing mcs at the same time amazing mcs
somehow mcs aingt that eyebrow - raising to me
from all of angles of us flash a mack loud enough
to cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt
hello  aiyyo what's up 
stop they know it's us
i used to be a loudmouth remember me
i'm the one who burned your house down well i'm out now
and this time i'm coming back to blow your house up
and i aingt gon' leave you a window to jump out of
give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
and you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
and when i go to hell and i'm getting ready to leave
i'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe
and we hit the trees 'til we look like vietnamese people
against peaceful see you in hell for the sequel
 see you in hell
wall street royce da 5'9 slim shady
see you in hell for the sequel 
bad meets evil what 
and so that's the story when bad meets evil
two of the most wanted individuals in the county
made jesse james and billy the kid look like law - abiding citizens
it's too bad they had to go out the way they did
got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon
but their spirits still live on till this day
shhh wait did y'all hear that
a lot of people ask me am i afraid of death
hell yeah i'm afraid of death
i don't want to die yet
a lot of people think that i worship the devil
that i do all types of retarded shit
look i can't change the way i think
and i can't change the way i am
but if i offended you good
cause i still don't give a fuck
i'm zonin off of one joint stoppin a limo
hopped in the window shoppin a demo at gunpoint
a lyricist without a clue what year is this
fuck a needle here's a sword bodypierce with this
livin amuk never givin a fuck
gimme the keys i'm drunk and i've never driven a truck
but i smoke dope in a cab
i'll stab you with the sharpest knife i can grab
come back the next week and re - open your scab 
a killer instinct runs in the blood
emptyin full clips and buryin guns in the mud
i've calmed down now  -  -  i was heavy once into drugs
i could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
my braings gone my soul's worn and my spirit is torn
the rest of my body's still bein operated on
i'm ducked the fuck down while i'm writin this rhyme
cause i'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin this time
for all the weed that i've smoked  -  yo this blunt's for you
to all the people i've offended  -  yeah fuck you too
to all the friends i used to have  -  yo i miss my past
but the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
for all the drugs that i've done  -  yo i'm still gon' do
for everytime i reminisce  -  yo i miss my past
but i still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass

and cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
i'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles
and pull you apart from both angles
i wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins
and bust open like broken water mains
so tell saddam not to bother with makin another bomb 
cause i'm crushin the whole world in my palm

and the pants to match 
i get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
a brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives
 causin hospital accidents

i wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
spend a million a track and went over my budget 
now how in the fuck am i supposed to get out of debt

never ran with a click  -  i'm a posse
kamikaze strappin a motherfuckin bomb across me
from the second i was born my momma lost me 
i'm a cross between manson esham and ozzy

lesson two: face em and diss em

a bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times

and the way things seem i shouldn't have to pay these shrinks

motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink
fuck that i'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
from fat bitch to off seventy - thousand pounds of her
from principal to the student body and counselor
from in - school to before school to out of school
i don't even believe in breathing i'm leaving air in your lungs
just to hear you keep screaming for me to seep it
ok i'm ready to go play
i got the machete from oj
i'm ready to make everyone's throat ache
you faggots keep egging me on
'til i have you at knifepoint then you beg me to stop
shut up give me your hands and feet
i said shut up when i'm talking to you
you hear me answer me
ha ha i'm just playing ladies
you know i love you
my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'll all be gray but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad
dear slim i wrote you but you still aingt calling
i left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in autumn you must not - a got 'em
there probably was a problem at the post office or something
sometimes i scribble addresses too sloppy when i jot 'em
but anyways; fuck it what's been up man how's your daughter
my girlfriend's pregnant too i'm bout to be a father
if i have a daughter guess what i'mma call her
i'mma name her bonnie
i read about your uncle ronnie too i'm sorry
i had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
i know you probably hear this everyday but i'm your biggest fan
i even got the underground shit that you did with skam
i got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
i like the shit you did with rawkus too that shit was phat
anyways i hope you get this man hit me back
just to chat truly yours your biggest fan
this is stan
dear slim you still aingt called or wrote i hope you have a chance
i aingt mad  -  i just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
if you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to but you coulda signed an autograph for matthew
that's my little brother man he's only six years old
we waited in the blistering cold for you
for four hours and you just said no
that's pretty shitty man  -  you're like his fucking idol
he wants to be just like you man he likes you more than i do
i aingt that mad though i just don't like being lied to
remember when we met in denver  -  you said if i'd write you
you would write back  -  see i'm just like you in a way
i never knew my father neither;
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
i can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when i have a shitty day i drift away and put 'em on
'cause i don't really got shit else so that shit helps when i'm depressed
i even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
it's like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see everything you say is real and i respect you 'cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous 'cause i talk about you 24/7
but she don't know you like i know you slim no one does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
you gotta call me man i'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
sincerely yours stan
ps
we should be together too
dear mister i'm - too - good - to - call - or - write - my - fans
this'll be the last package i ever send your ass
it's been six months and still no word i don't deserve it
i know you got my last two letters;
i wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
so this is my cassette i'm sending you i hope you hear it
i'm in the car right now i'm doing 90 on the freeway
hey slim i drank a fifth of vodka you dare me to drive
you know the song by phil collins in the air tonight
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didn't then phil saw it all then at a show he found him
that's kinda how this is you coulda rescued me from drowning
now it's too late i'm on a 1000 downers now i'm drowsy
and all i wanted was a lousy letter or a call
i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i love you slim we coulda been together think about it
you ruined it now i hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
and when you dream i hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
i hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
see slim - shut up bitch i'm trying to talk
hey slim that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk
but i didn't slit her throat i just tied her up see i aingt like you
'cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
well gotta go i'm almost at the bridge now
oh shit i forgot how'm i supposed to send this shit out
dear stan i meant to write you sooner but i've just been busy
you said your girlfriend's pregnant now how far along is she
look i'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother
i wrote it on the starter cap
i'm sorry i didn't see you at the show i musta missed you
don't think i did that shit intentionally just to diss you
but what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
i say that shit just clowning dogg
c'mon how fucked up is you
you got some issues stan i think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
and what's this shit about us meant to be together
that type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
i really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
i hope you get to read this letter i just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself i think that you'll be doing just fine
if you relax a little i'm glad i inspire you but stan
why are you so mad try to understand that i do want you as a fan
i just don't want you to do some crazy shit
i seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape but they didn't say who it was to
come to think about it his name was it was you

and sells a couple of million records
and these motherfuckers hit the ceiling

i make fight music for high school kids
i put lives at risk when i drive like this 
i put wives at risk with a knife like this 
shit you probably think i'm in your tape deck now
i'm in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
ducked the fuck way down waitin to straight jump out
put it over your mouth and grab you by the face what now
oh  -  you want me to watch my mouth how
take my fuckin eyeballs out and turn em around
look  -  i'll burn your fuckin house down circle around
and hit the hydrant so you can't put your burning furniture out
 i'm sorry there must be a mix - up
you want me to fix up lyrics while the president gets his dick sucked
 fuck that take drugs rape sluts
make fun of gay clubs men who wear make - up
get aware wake up get a sense of humor
quit tryin to censor music this is for your kid's amusement
 but don't blame me when lil' eric jumps off of the terrace
you shoulda been watchin him  -  apparently you aingt parents
cause i never knew i knew i would get this big
i never knew i knew i'd effect this kid
i never knew i'd get him to slit his wrist
i never knew i'd get him to hit this bitch
i never knew i knew i would get this big
so who's bringin the guns in this country 
i couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in london
and last week i seen a schwarzaneggar movie
where he's shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi
i sees three little kids up in the front row
screamin go with their 17 - year - old uncle
i'm like guidance  -  aingt they got the same moms and dads
who got mad when i asked if they liked violence
and told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
what about the make - up you allow your 12 - year - old daughter to wear
 so tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
when his bus driver's screamin at him fuckin him up worse
and fuck was the first word i ever learned
up in the third grade flippin the gym teacher the bird 
so read up about how i used to get beat up
peed on be on free lunch and change school every 3 months
my life's like kinda what my wife's like 
fucked up after i beat her fuckin ass every night ike
so how much easier would life be
if 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me
i never knew i knew i'd
have a new house or a new car
a couple years ago i was more poorer than you are
i don't got that bad of a mouth do i

 violent ground told me to go fuck myself

 tower records told me to shove this record up my ass 
do you know what it feels like 
to be told to have a record shoved up your ass
 but i
 i'm gonna lose my fucking job over this 
you know why dre's record was so successful 
he's rapping about big - screen tvs blunts 40's and bitches 
you're rapping about homosexuals and vicadin
 i mean - 
 i can't sell this shit
 either change the record or it's not coming out
 what i

 what am i supposed
 now
 alright man
whatever
dre just let it run
aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
aiyyo this song is for anyone fuck it
just shut up and listen aiyyo
i sit back with this pack of zig zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this  -  on this earth
and since birth i've been cursed with this curse to just curse
and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensing these sentences
getting this stress that's been eating me recently off of this chest
and i rest again peacefully 
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone when you freaks see me out
in the streets when i'm eating or feeding my daughter
do not come and speak to me 
i don't know you and no
i don't owe you a motherfucking thing
i'm not mr n'sync i'm not what your friends think
i'm not mr friendly i can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty 
no patience is in me and if you offend me
i'm lifting you 10 feet  in the air
i don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
i'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
i'm tired of all you 
i don't mean to be mean but that's all i can be it's just me
and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news everyday i am
radio won't even play my jam
'cause i am whatever you say i am
i don't know it's just the way i am
sometimes i just feel like my father
i hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it's constant
and oh it's his lyrical content  - 
 -  the song 'guilty conscience' has gotten such rotten responses
and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me 
so i point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of shit too
when a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on marilyn  and the heroin
where were the parents at and look where it's at
middle america now it's a tragedy
now it's so sad to see an upper class city
having this happening 
then attack eminem 'cause i rap this way 
but i'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire
to burn and it's burning and i have returned
i'm so sick and tired of being admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label let's stop with the fables
i'm not gonna be able to top on my name is 
and pigeon - holed into some pop - py sensation
that got me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
and i just do not got the patience 
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
i'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause i talk
with an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep asking
the same fucking questions 
what school did i go to what hood i grew up in
the why the who what when the where and the how
'til i'm grabbing my hair and i'm tearing it out
'cause they driving me crazy  i can't take it
i'm racing i'm pacing i stand and i sit
and i'm thankful for every fan that i get
but i can't take a shit in the bathroom
without someone standing by it
no i won't sign your autograph
you can call me an asshole i'm glad
may i have your attention please
will the real slim shady please stand up
i repeat will the real slim shady please stand up
we're gonna have a problem here
y'all act like you never seen a white person before
jaws all on the floor like pam and tommy just burst in the door
and started whooping her ass worse than before
they first were divorced throwing her over furniture 
it's the return of the ah wait no way you're kidding
he didn't just say what i think he did did he
and dr dre said nothing you idiots
dr dre's dead he's locked in my basement 
feminist women love eminem
slim shady i'm sick of him
look at him walking around grabbing his you - know - what
flipping the you - know - who yeah but he's so cute though
yeah i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose but can't
but it's cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
my bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
and if i'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
of course they gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit fourth grade
they got the discovery channel don't they
we aingt nothing but mammals well some of us cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes 
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
 but if you feel like i feel i got the antidote
women wave your pantyhose sing the chorus and it goes
'cause i'm slim shady yes i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up please stand up
will smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records;
well i do so fuck him and fuck you too
you think i give a damn about a grammy
half of you critics can't even stomach me let alone stand me
but slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird
why so you guys could just lie to get me here
so you can sit me here next to britney spears
yo shit christina aguilera better switch me chairs
so i can sit next to carson daly and fred durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
little bitch put me on blast on mtv
yeah he's cute but i think he's married to kim hee - hee
i should download her audio on mp3
and show the whole world how you gave eminem vd 
i'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
so i have been sent here to destroy you 
and there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me; walk talk and act like me
it just might be the next best thing but not quite me
i'm like a head trip to listen to cause i'm only giving you
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
the only difference is i got the balls to say it
in front of y'all and i don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
i just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it  i just shit it
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums
it's funny; 'cause at the rate i'm going when i'm thirty
i'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
pinching nurses asses when i'm jacking off with jergens
and i'm jerking but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
and every single person is a slim shady lurking
he could be working at burger king spitting on your onion rings
 or in the parking lot circling
screaming i don't give a fuck
with his windows down and his system up
so will the real shady please stand up

so i promised the fuckin critics
i wouldn't say fuckin for six minutes
my baby's mom bitch made me an angry blonde
so i made me a song killed her and put hailie on
i may be wrong i keep thinkin these crazy thoughts
in my cranium but i'm stuck with a crazy mom
came home and somebody musta broke in the back window
and stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
sick sick dreams of picnic scenes two kids sixteen
with m - 16's and ten clips each
and them shits reach through six kids each
and slim gets blamed in bill clint's speech to fix these streets
fuck that pbbt tou faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
and re - appear in hell with a can of gas and a match
aftermath dre grab the gat show 'em where it's at
don't you remember me
remember me
that's why they call me slim shady  
i'm back   i'm back
i murder a rhyme one word at a time
you never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
you better get rid of that nine it aingt gonna help
what good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself
i'm waitin for hell like hell shit i'm anxious as hell
manson you're safe in that cell be thankful it's jail
i used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
thirteen i was puttin shells in a gauge on a shelf
i used to get punked and bullied on my block
'til i cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
 i used to give a  -  fuck now i could give a fuck less
what do i think of suc - cess it sucks too much press i'm stressed
too much stares two breasts too upset
it's just too much mess i guess i must just blew up quick 
grew up quick  was raised right
whatever you say is wrong whatever i say is right
you think of my name now whenever you say hi
became a commodity because i'm w - h - i - 
 - t - e cuz mtv was so friendly to me
can't wait 'til kim sees me
now is it worth it look at my life how is it perfect
read my lips bitch what my mouth isn't workin
you hear this finger oh it's upside down
here let me turn this motherfucker up right now
i take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music
and if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe 
 my name is slim shady
i been crazy way before radio didn't play me
the sensational 
with ken kaniff who just finds the men edible
it's ken kaniff on the internet
tryin to lure your kids with him into bed
it's a sick world we live in these days
slim for pete's sakes put down christopher reeve's legs
geez you guys are so sensitive
slim it's a touchy subject try and just don't mention it
mind with no sense in it fried to get so frenetic
whose eyes get so squinted i'm blind from smokin 'em
with my windows tinted with nine limos rented
doin lines of coke in 'em with a bunch of guys hoppin out 
all high and indo scented 
and that's where i get my name from that's why they call me
i take seven  from  stand 'em all in line
add an ak - 47 a revolver a nine
a mack - 11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
and that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
cause  shady they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole y2k thing
and by the way n'sync why do they sing
am i the only one who realizes they stink
should i dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings
it's why i tend to block out when i hear things
cause all these fans screamin is makin my ears ring 
so i just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that i was stickin it to christina
cause if i ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
it'd be jennifer lopez and puffy you know this
i'm sorry puff but i don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
i still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
and have a son and a new brother at the same time

my fuckin bitch mom's suin for ten million
she must want a dollar for every pill i've been stealin

a half - brother and sister who never seen me
or even bothered to call me until they saw me on tv
now everybody's so happy and proud
i'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
hey - hey and then to top it off i walked to the newsstand
to buy this cheap - ass little magazine with a food stamp
skipped to the last page flipped right fast
and what do i see a picture of my big white ass
okay let me give you motherfuckers some help:
uhh here  -  double xl double xl
now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
ahh fuck it i'll even buy a couple myself
 yeah hahahahawhooooo shit
 guess what i aingt coming in yet
i'll come in a minute
 ayothis is my love songit goes like this
back when mark walhberg was marky mark
this is how we used to make the party start
we used to mix hen' with bacardi dark
and when it kicks in you can hardly talk
and by the sixth gin you're gonna probably crawl
and you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
and my pre - diction is you're gonna probably fall
either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
and everything's spinning
you're begining to think women
are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
you are now allowed to officially slap bitches
you have the right to remain violent and start wiling
start a fight with the same guy that was smart eying you
get in your car start it and start driving
over the island and cause a 42 car pile - up
earth calling pilot to co - pilot
looking at the life on this planet sir no sign of it
all i can see is a bunch of smoke flying
and i'm so high that i might die if i go by it
let me out of this place
i'm outta place
i'm in outer space
i've just vanished without a trace
i'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
i'll be back in an hour or so
'cause every time i go to try to leave
someone keeps pulling on my sleeve
i don't wanna but i gotta stay
these drugs really got a hold of me
'cause every time i try to tell them no
they won't let me ever let them go
i'm a sucker all i gotta say
in third grade all i used to do
was sniff glue through a tube and play rubic's cube
17 years later i'm as rude as jude
scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs
i've got no game
and every face looks the same
they've got no name
so i don't need game to play
i just say whatever i want to whoever i want
whenever i want wherever i want however i want
however i do show some respect to few
as ecstasy got me standing next to you
getting sentimental as fuck spilling guts to you
we just met
but i think i'm in love with you
but you're on it too
so you tell me you love me too
wake up in the morning like yo what the fuck we do
i gotta go bitch
you know i have stuff to do
'cause if i get caught cheating then i'm stuck with you
but in the long run
these drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later
but fuck it i'm on one
so let's enjoy
let the x destroy your spinal cord
so it's not a straight line no more
'til we walk around looking like some wind - up dolls
shit's sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
shit six hits won't even get me high no more
so bye for now
i'm going to try to find some more
that's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
when you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
and tomorrow you're probably going to want to do it again
what's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend screw it
and what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning
and what's a little fight
tomorrow you'll be boys again
it's your life
live it however you wanna
marijuana is everywhere
where was you brought up
it don't matter as long as you get where you're going
'cause none of the shit is going to mean shit where we're going
they tell you to stop but you just sit there ignoring
even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning
but you're young
you've got a lot of drugs to do
girls to screw
parties to crash
sucks to be you
if i could take it all back now i wouldn't
i would have did more shit that people said that i shouldn't
but i'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
did better drugs and updated
but i've still got a lot of growing up to do
i've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew
but when it's all said and done i'll be 40
before i know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
with a bottle of jack
two grandkids in my lap
babysitting for hailie while hailie's out getting smashed
drugs really got a hold of me
they really got a hold of me
'cause drugs really got a hold of me

okay children quiet down quiet down
children i'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
his name is mr shady
children quiet down please
brian don't throw that 
mr shady will be your new substitute 
while mr kaniff is out with pneumonia 
good luck mr shady
hi there little boys and girls 
today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
but first i'd like you to meet my friend bob 
say hi bob  bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
and he don't got a job cause bob sits at home and smokes pot
but his twelve - year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks 
and even if they escaped and they got the cops
the ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge
'til one night mrs stacey went off the job
when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
but stacey knew it was bob and said knock it off
but bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker
crazier than slim shady is off the vodka
you couldn't even take him to dre's to get bob a dr
he grabbed stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
but ever since the day stacey went off to wander
they never found her and bob still hangs at the waffle diner
and that's the story of bob and his marijuana 
and what it might do to you
so see if the squirrels want any  -  it's bad for you 
see children drugs are bahhhd 
and if you don't believe me ask ya dahhhd 
and if you don't believe him ask ya mom 
she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time 
so kids say no to drugs 
so you don't act like everyone else does 
then there's really nothin else to say 
drugs are just bad mmm'kay
my penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it 
fuck no you aingt seen it it's the size of a peanut 
speakin of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels
ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
if someone ever offers it to you don't do it
kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is final you won't get it back
so don't get attached it'll attack every bone in your back
meet zach twenty - one years old 
after hangin out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold
and decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
suddenly he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive
and his eyes roll back in his skull  
his back starts tah  -  look like the mcdonald's arches
he's on donald's carpet layin horizontal barfin 
and everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him
hey adam zach is a jackass look at him
cause they took it too so they think it's funny
so they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money
meanwhile zach's in a coma the action is over
and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin yoga
and that's the story of zach the ecstasy maniac
so don't even feed that to squirrels class cause it's bad for you
and there's really nothin else to say 
and last but not least one of the most humungous
problems among young people today is fungus
it grows from cow manure they pick it out wipe it off 
bag it up and you put it right in your mouth and chew it
yum yum then you start to see some dumb stuff
and everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
and sometimes you see things that aren't there 
like fat woman in g - strings with orange hair
 it's yarn claire
women stick 'em up their behinds go out and wear 'em 
and if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
whoops did i say magic mushrooms i meant fungus
ya tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue 
cause it comes from a cow's dung 
see drugs are bad it's a common fact
but your mom and dad know that's all that i'm good at 
but don't be me cause if you grow up and you go and od
they're gonna come for me and i'ma have to grow a goatee
and get a disguise and hide cause it'll be my fault
so don't do drugs and do exactly as i don't 
cause i'm bad for you
come on children clap along 
sing along children 
drugs are just bad drugs are just bad 
so don't do drugs 
so there'll be more for me 
america hahaha we love you how many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful
country of ours the stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect
the women and men who have broke their neck's for the freedom of speech the united states
government has sworn to uphold or
 so we're told
i never would've dreamed in a million years i'd see
so many motherfucking people who feel like me who share the same views
and the same exact beliefs it's like a fucking army marching in back of me so many lives i
touch so much anger aimed in no particular direction just sprays and sprays and straight
through your radio waves it plays and plays 'till it stays stuck in your head for days and
days who would of thought standing in this mirror bleaching my hair with some peroxide
reaching for a t - shirt to wear that i would catapult to the forefront of rap like this how
could i predict my words would have an impact like this i must've struck a chord with somebody
up in the office cause congress keeps telling me i aingt causing nuthing but problems and now
they're saying i'm in trouble with the government i'm loving it i shoveled shit all my life
and now i'm dumping it on
white america i could be one of your kids white america little eric looks just like this
white america erica loves my shit i go to trl look how many hugs i get white america i
could be one of your kids white america little eric looks just like this white america erica
loves my shit i go to trl look how many hugs i get
look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself if they were brown shady lose shady
sits on the shelf but shady's cute shady knew shady's dimple's would help make ladies swoon

aingt have to graduate from lincoln high school to know that but i could rap so fuck school

underground no one gave a fuck i was white no labels wanted to sign me almost gave up i was
like fuck it until i met dre the only one to look past gave me a chance and i lit a fire up
under his ass helped him get back to the top every fan black that i got was probably his in
exchange for every white fan that he's got like damn we just swapped sitting back looking at
shit wow i'm like my skin is it starting to work to my benefit now it's
see the problem is i speak to suburban kids who otherwise would of never knew these words
exist whose mom's probably would of never gave two squirts of piss 'till i created so much
motherfucking turbulence straight out the tube right into your living room i came and kids
flipped when they knew i was produced by dre that's all it took and they were instantly hooked
right in and they connected with me too because i looked like them that's why they put my
lyrics up under this microscope searching with a fine tooth comb its like this rope waiting
to choke tightening around my throat watching me while i write this like i don't like this
nope all i hear is lyrics lyrics constant controversy sponsors working 'round the clock to
try to stop my concerts early surely hip - hop was never a problem in harlem only in boston
after it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom so now i'm catching the flack

say faggot shit just look at me like i'm your closest pal the posterchild the motherfucking

friends same blonde hair same rap channel good night everyone thank you for coming your
host for the evening  oh ha
where's my snare
i have no snare in my headphones  -  there you go
yeah yo yo
have you ever been hated or discriminated against
i have; i've been protested and demonstrated against
picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times
sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
all this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as i'm breathing
keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
see they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out
look at me now; i bet ya probably sick of me now aingt you mama
i'mma make you look so ridiculous now
i'm sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry; but tonight
i'm cleaning out my closet 
i said i'm sorry mama
i never meant to make you cry but tonight
i'm cleaning out my closet
ha i got some skeletons in my closet
and i don't know if no one knows it
so before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
i'mma expose it; i'll take you back to '73
before i ever had a multi - platinum selling cd
i was a baby maybe i was just a couple of months
my faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'cause he split i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no i don't on second thought i just fucking wished he would die
i look at hailie and i couldn't picture leaving her side
even if i hated kim i grit my teeth and i'd try
to make it work with her at least for hailie's sake
i maybe made some mistakes
but i'm only human but i'm man enough to face them today
what i did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
but the smartest shit i did was take them bullets outta that gun
'cause i'da killed him; shit i would've shot kim and him both
it's my life i'd like to welcome y'all to the eminem show
now i would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissing
but put yourself in my position; just try to envision
witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen
bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
going through public housing systems victim of munchhausen's syndrome
my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasn't
'til i grew up now i blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach
doesn't it wasn't it the reason you made that cd for me ma
so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma
but guess what you're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
and nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
and hailie's getting so big now; you should see her she's beautiful
but you'll never see her  -  she won't even be at your funeral
see what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
bitch do your song  -  keep telling yourself that you was a mom
but how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
you selfish bitch; i hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
well guess what i am dead  -  dead to you as can be
people it feels so good to be back
ladies and gentleman introducing the new and improved you know who
never been the type to bend or budge
the wrong button to push

 maarrsshh
i'm a soldier i'm a soldier i'm a soldier i'm a soldier
yo' never was a thug just infatuated with guns 
never was a gangsta 'til i graduated to one
and got the rep of a villain for weapon concealing 
took the image of a thug kept shit appealing 
willing to stick out my neck for respect if it meant life or death 
never live to regret what i said 
when you're me people just want to see 
if it's true if it's you what you say in your rap's what you do 
so they feel as part of your obligation to fulfill 
when they see you on the streets face to face are you for real 
in confrontation aingt no conversation if you feel you're in violation 
any hesitation'll get you killed if you feel it kill it 
if you conceal it reveal it being reasonable will leave you full of bullets 
pull it squeeze it till it's empty tempt me push me pussies 
i need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze
i'm a soldier these shoulder's hold up so much they won't budge 
i'll never fall or fold up
i'm a soldier 
even if my collar bone's crush or crumble 
i will never slip or stumble 
these shoulder's hold up so much they won't budge 
i'll never fall or fold up 
i will never stumble
i love pissing you off it get's me off 
like my lawyer's when the fucking judge let's me off
all you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off 
i'll violate and all the motherfucking bet's be off 
i'm a lit fuse anything i do bitche it's news 
pistol whipping motherfucking bouncers six - two 
who needs bullets soon as i pull it you sweat bullets 
an excellent method to get rid of the next bully 
it's actually better cause instead you murdering 
you can hurt em' and come back again and kick dirt at 'em 
it's like pouring salt in the wounds assault and get sued 
you can smell the lawsuits soon as i waltz in the room 
everybody halts and stops calls the cops
all you see is bitches coming out their halter tops 
running and ducking out the hard rocks parking lot 
you'll all get shot whether its your fault or not cause
i spit it slow so these kids know that i'm talking to 'em 
give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em 
i'm like a thug with a little bit of pac influence 
i spew it and look how i got you bitches rocking to it 
you motherfuckers could never do it like i could do it 
don't even try it you'll look stupid do not pursue it 
don't ever in your life try to knock the truest 
i spit the illest shit ever been dropped to two inch 
so ticky - tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock 
listen to the sound of kim as she licks on a cock 
listen to the sound of me spilling my heart through this pen 
motherfuckers know that i'll never be marshall again 
full of controversy until i retire my jersey 
'til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty and
lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me 
and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity i'm a
yo' left yo' left yo' left 
right left 
right left
saying goodbye saying goodbye to hollywood
 saying goodbye saying goodbye to hollywood
i thought i had it all figured out i did
i thought i was tough enough to stick it out with kim
but i wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
i found myself laying on my knees in cuffs
which should've been a reason enough for me to get my stuff and just leave
how come i couldn't see this shit myself it's just me
nobody couldn't see the shit i felt
knowing damn well she wasn't gonna be there when i fell to catch me
the minute shit was heated she just bailed
i'm standing here swinging on like thirty people by myself
i couldn't even see the millimetere when it fell
turned around saw gary stashing the heater in his belt
saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
i just sold two million records i don't need to go to jail
i'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
i need to slow down
try to get my feet on solid ground so for now i'm
bury my face in comic books cause i don't want to look
at nothing this world's too much
i've swallowed all i could
if i could swallow a bottle of tylenol i would and end it for good
just say goodbye to hollywood
i probably should these problems are piling all at once
cause everything that bothers me i got it bottled up
i think i'm bottoming out
but i'm not about to give up i gotta get up
thank god i got a little girl
and i'm a responsible father
so not a lot of good i'd be to my daughter laying in the bottom of the mud
must be in my blood cause i don't know how i do it
all i know is i don't want to follow in the footsteps of my dad
cause i hate him so bad
the worst fear that i had was growing up to be like his fucking ass man
if you could understand why i am the way that i am
what do i say to my fans when i tell 'em i'm
i don't wanna quit but shit i feel like this is it
for me to have this much appeal like this is sick
this is not a game this fame in real life this is sick
publicity stunt my ass conceal my fucking dick
fuck the guns i'm done i'll never look at gats
if i scrap i'll scrap like i aingt never whooped some ass
i love my fans
but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact i've sacrificed everything i have
i never dreamt i'd get to the level that i'm at this is whack
this is more than i ever could of asked
everywhere i go a hat a sweater hood or mask
what about math how come i wasn't ever good at that
it's like the boy in the bubble who never could adapt i'm trapped
if i could go back i never woulda rapped
i sold my soul to the devil i'll never get it back
i just wanna leave this game with level head intact
imagine going from being a no one to seeing
everything blow up and all you did was just grow
up emceeing
it's fucking crazy
cause all i wanted was to give hailie the life i never had
but instead i forced us to live alienated so i'm saying
goodbye goodbye hollywood 
please don't cry for me when i'm gone for good
so goodbye goodbye hollywood

any violence of any sort but what's she shoving me for doesn't she love me no more wasn't she
hugging me four minutes ago at the door man i'm this close to going toe - to - toe with this
whore what would you do if she was telling you she wants a divorce she's having another baby
in a month and it's yours and you find out it isn't cause this bitch has been visiting someone
else and sucking his dick and kissing you on the lips when you get back to michigan now the
plot is thickening worse cause you feel like you've been sticking your fucking dick in a
hearse so you paranoid at every little cold that you get ever since they told you this shit

guess who's back
i've created a monster 'cause nobody wants to
see marshall no more they want shady i'm chopped liver
well if you want shady this is what i'll give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka that'll jumpstart my heart quicker than a
shock when i get shocked at the hospital by the doctor when i'm not cooperating
when i'm rocking the table while he's operating 
you waited this long now stop debating 'cause i'm back
i'm on the rag and ovulating
i know that you got a job ms cheney but your husband's heart problem's complicating
so the fcc won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
they tried to shut me down on mtv but it feels so empty without me
so come on dip bum on your lips fuck that
cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
i just settled all my lawsuits
fuck you debbie
now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me
little hellions kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed their parents still listen to elvis
they start feeling like prisoners helpless
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch
a visionary vision is scary could start a revolution polluting the air waves a rebel
so just let me revel and bask in the fact that i got everyone kissing my ass
and it's a disaster such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
well i'm back 
fix your bent antennae tune it in and then i'm gonna
enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
the center of attention back for the winter
i'm interesting the best thing since wrestling
infesting in your kids ears and nesting
testing attention please
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
a nuisance who sent you sent for me
a tisk - it a task - it i'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit that shit
chris kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little limp bizkit bastards and moby
you can get stomped by obie you 36 year old bald headed fag blow me
you don't know me you're too old let go it's over nobody listens to techno
now let's go just give me the signal i'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
i've been dope suspenseful with a pencil ever since
prince turned himself into a symbol
but sometimes the shit just seems everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean i'm disgusting but it's just me i'm just obscene
though i'm not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley to do black music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy 
there's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea it'd be so empty without me
kids
em it's paul
listen joel just called me and he said you're in the fucking back behind his studio
shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range
i told you not to fucking bring your gun around like an idiot outside of your home
you're gonna get yourself in trouble
don't bring your gun outside of your home you can't carry it on you
leave your fuckin gun at home
these ideas are nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no bearing it's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
to see him walking around with his headphones blaring
alone in his own zone cold and he don't care
he's a problem child
what bothers him all comes out when he talks about
his fucking dad walking out
'cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
his thoughts are whacked he's mad so he's talking back
talking black brainwashed from rock and rap
he sags his pants do - rags and a stocking cap
his step - father hit him so he socked him back and broke his nose
his house is a broken home there's no control he just let's his emotions go
 sing with me  sing for the years
 sing for the laughter sing for the tears 
sing it with me just for today maybe tomorrow the good lord'll take you away
entertainment is changing intertwining with gangsters
in the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
holy or unholy only have one homie
only this gun lonely 'cause don't anyone know me
yet everybody just feels like they can relate i guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate
it's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum
now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
from standing on corners and porches just rapping
to having a fortune no more kissing ass
but then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you
fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you
to get their hands on every dime you have they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
that's why these prosecutors wanna convict me strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
but all they kids be listening to me religiously so i'm signing cds while police fingerprint me
they're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
if i'm such a fucking menace this shit doesn't make sense pete
it's all political if my music is literal and i'm a criminal how the fuck can i raise a little girl
i couldn't i wouldn't be fit to you're full of shit too guerrera that was a fist that hit you
they say music can alter moods and talk to you
well can it load a gun up for you  and cock it too
well if it can then the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
see what these kids do is hear about us toting pistols
and they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
not knowing we really just protecting ourselves we entertainers
of course the shit's affecting our sales you ignoramus
but music is reflection of self we just explain it and then we get our cheques in the mail
it's fucked up aingt it
how we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fucking thing that we wanted
that's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine
who post pin - up pictures on their walls all day long
idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs
or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
till they sit and they cry at night wishing they'd die
till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
we're nothing to you but we're the fucking shit in their eyes
that's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it squeeze it and hold it
'cause we consider these minutes golden
and maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
just let our spirits live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can
oh
you high baby
ya
talk to me
you want me to tell you something
uh - huh
i know what you want to hear
'cause i know you want me baby i think i want you too

but i do know one thing though bitches they come they go

maybe i'll love you one day maybe we'll someday grow
'til then just sit your drunk ass on that fucking runway ho
'cause i can't be your superman
can't be your superman
i can't be your superman
your superman your superman
don't get me wrong i love these ho's
it's no secret everybody knows
yeah we fucked bitch so what
that's about as far as your body goes
we'll be friends i'll call you again i'll chase you around every bar you attend
never know what kind of car i'll be in we'll see how much you'll be partying then
you don't want that neither do i
i don't want to flip when i see you with guys
too much pride between you and i
not a jealous man but females lie
but i guess that's just what sluts do how could it ever be just us two
i'd never love you enough to trust you we just met and i just fucked you
first thing you say i'm not fazed i hang around big stars all day
i don't see what the big deal is anyways
you're just plain old marshall to me
ooh ya' girl run that game
hailie jade i love that name love that tattoo what's that say
rot in pieces uh that's great
first off you don't know marshall at all so don't grow partial
that's ammo for my arsenal i'll slap you off that bar stool
there goes another lawsuit leave hand prints all across you
good lordy whoadie you must be gone off that water bottle
you want what you can't have ooh girl that's too damn bad
don't touch what you can't grab end up with two backhands
put anthrax on a tampax and slap you 'til you can't stand
girl you just blew your chance don't mean to ruin your plans
yo i can't sing but
i feel like singing
i wanna fucking sing
'cause i'm happy
yeah i'm happy
i got my baby back
yo check it out
some days i sit staring out the window
watching this world pass me by
sometimes i think there's nothing to live for
i almost break down and cry
sometimes i think i'm crazy
i'm crazy oh so crazy
why am i here am i just wasting my time
but then i see my baby
suddenly i'm not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes
sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
everyone's leaning on me
'cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
but then she comes back to me
my baby girl  keeps getting older
i watch her grow up with pride
people make jokes 'cause they don't understand me
they just don't see my real side
i act like shit don't phase me
inside it drives me crazy
my insecurities could eat me alive
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes oh no
man if i could sing i'd keep singing this song to my daughter
if i could hit the notes i'd blow something as long as my father
to show her how i feel about her how proud i am that i got her
god i'm a daddy i'm so glad that her mom didn't 
now you probably get this picture from my public persona
that i'm a pistol - packing drug - addict who bags on his mama
but i wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'cause there's a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul
and just know that i grow colder the older i grow
this boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
and this load is like the weight of the world
and i think my neck is breaking
should i just give up or try to live up to these expectations
now look i love my daughter more than life in itself
but i got a wife that's determined to make my life living hell
but i handle it well given the circumstances i'm dealt
so many chances man it's too bad could've had someone else
but the years that i've wasted are nothing to the tears that i've tasted
so here's what i'm facing:
3 felonies 6 years of probation
i've went to jail for this woman
i've been to bat for this woman
i've taken bats to people's backs bent over backwards for this woman
man i should've seen it coming what'd i stick my penis up in
would've ripped the pre - nup up if i'd seen what she was fucking
but fuck it it's over there's no more reason to cry no more
i got my baby baby the only lady that i adore hailie
so sayonara try tomorrow nice to know ya
my baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
and suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
it's like the greatest gift you can get
the weight has been lifted
and now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
'cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
nothing can take her from me
woo
i told you i can't sing
oh well i tried
hailie 'member when i said
if you ever need anything daddy will be right there
guess what
daddy's here
and i aingt going nowhere baby
i love you 
 this muthafucka man
 it's ridiculous i can't believe it hold on em
 have a seatdre i'll call you back
 what now
 i don't even know where to start
 i got the album from upstairs
 and
 and this is by far the most
 incredible thing i've ever heard
music reality sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
but we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
sike
if i were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
would you feel sorrow or show love
or would it matter
can never be the lead - off batter of things
shit for me to feed off
i'm see - saw battling
but theres way too much at stake for me to be fake
there's too much on my plate
and i came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
and not say what i got to say
what the fuck you take me for a joke you smoking crack
before i do that i beg mariah to take me back
i get up 'for i get down run myself in the ground 'for i put some wack shit out
i'm trying - a smack this one out the park five - thousand mark
you all steady trying to drown the shark
aingt gonna do nothing but piss me off
lid to the can of whoop ass just twist me off
see me leap out pull the piece out fuck shooting i'm just trying to knock his teeth out
fuck with me now bitch let's see you freestyle
talk is cheap motherfucker if you're really feeling froggish leap
you're slim you're gonna let him get away with that
he tried to play you you can't let him 'scape with that
man i hate this crap this aingt rap
this is crazy the way we act
when we confuse hip - hop with real life when the music stops
there aingt no getting rid of mcveigh
if so you would've tried
the only way i'm leaving this bitch is suicide
i have died clinically arrived back at my enemy's crib with hennessey
got drunk then i finished he
i'm every niggas favorite arch - enemy
physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
i spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently
i'm not what you think
i appear to be fucked up
mentally endangered
i can't stay away from a razor
i just want my face in a paper
i wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
i murder you
danger had me turned into a mad man son of sam bitch i'm surgical
i'll allergic to dying you think not you got balls we can see how large
when the music stops
i was happy having a deal at first
thought money would make me happy but
it only made my pain worst
it hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg
when you aingt got nothing left but your word and your balls
and you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
begging with they hands out
checking for your record when its selling
when it aingt that's the end no laughs
no friends no girl
just the gin you drink till you car spin you then
u slam into the wall and you fall
out the car trying to crawl with one arm
about to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
if my funeral's tomorrow wonder if they would even call when the music stops
let's see how many of your men loyal
when i pull up looking for you
with a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil
i'm revved up who said what would lead bust your head would just explode
with red stuff i'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon
braggin about how you shot it like a coward bullets devour you showered you
niggas if i was you niggas i'll run while given the chance
understand i can enchance the spirit of man
death itself it can't hurt me just the thought of dying alone that really
irks me you aingt worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
be smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark
hug the floor while we plan tug - o - war with your life fuck the tour and the mic
i'll rather fuck a whore with a knife deliver that shit the coroner's like
you high hype popping shit in broad day light nigga your a gonna at night
instigators turn pits in cages
let loose and bit the neighbours wrist to razors
you all don't want war you want talk
in the dark my dogs all bark like woof
proof nigga i'm a wolf get your whole roof
caved in like reindeer hoofs
stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose
the more you all breach the more i moves
this hill street this is hardcore blues
put a gun to rap checking all our jewels 
or make the news betcha all you all move
when the uzi pop you better drop when the music stop
music's changed my life in so many ways
brains confused and fucked since the 5th grade
ll told me to rock the bells
nwa said fuck the police
now i'm in jail
93 was strictly r&b
fucked up hair cut
listen to jodeci
michael jackson who gonna tell me i aingt mike
ass cheeks painted white
fucking presilla at night
flying down sunset smoking crack
transvestite in the front
eddi murphy in the back
mop had me grindy and griddy
marilyn manson i dyed my hair blue
and grew some titties
ludacris told me to throw them bowls
now i'm in the hospital
broken nose and a fractured elbow
voices in my head i'm going in shock
i'm reaching for the glock but the music stops
huh so i'm out the game huh
yo dre we riding
well i'm with you homie
ok let's handle this small shit
i was born to brew up storms 'n stir up shit
kick up dust cuss 'til i slur up spit
grew up too quick went through too much knew too much shit
corrupt and i'm pour it on like syrup bitch
thick in gritz sick and twisted mr buttersworth
dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
till the cow just tilts and tips 'n stumbles to earth
and if i fumble the verse keep going
first take i make mistakes just keep it
no punches pull no punches that's weak shit
fake shit if i ever take shit i eat shit
wasn't for him i wouldn't be shit
creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
been here longer than anyone in the game
and i aingt got to lie about my age
but what about jermaine
fuck jermaine he don't belong speaking mine or timbaland's name
and don't think i don't read your little interviews and see what your saying
i'm a giant and i aingt gotta move till i'm provoked
when i see you i'ma step on you and not even know it
ya midget mini - me with a bunch of little mini - you's
running around your backyard swimming pools
over 80 million records sold
and i aingt have to do it with 10 or 11 year olds
cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
so who you playing with huh huh huh huh
second verse it gets worse
it gets no better than this
amateurs drink veteran piss
from a dixie cup if you ever mix me up
or confuse me with a cannabis or dre with a dupri
will rub it in every club your in we'll have you
blackballed and make sure you never rap a fucking again
dre aingt having it as long as i'm here to play devil's advocate
if there was some magic shit i could wave
over the industry that could save it when i'm gone
and bury to make sure the tradition carries on
i would
if i could only use this power for good
i wouldn't not even if i could
from the hood and i'm a hornet
and i'ma only sting when i'm cornered
and i'ma only sucker punch or swing without warning
and swing to knock somebody's fucking head off
cause i know when they get up i won't get a chance to let off
another punch i'm punk - rock no one's punk
don't give a fuck white pac so much spunk
when i was little i knew i would blow up
and sell a mil or grow up to be attila
go nuts and be a killer
and i'm something of a phenom
one puff of the chron
i'm unstoppable i'm alive i'm on top again
there's no obstacle that i can't conquer
so come along with us 
now anybody who knows dre
knows i'm about fast cars and alize partying all day
but i handle my business cause it's work before play
don't look for trouble but i serve you gourmet
however you want it you could have it your way
you fuck my night up i'ma fuck up your day
bullet with your name sending it your way
that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
cause this is my space you invade it
live to regret it and you die trying to violate it
fuck around and you'll get annihilated
eyes dilated
ha like my old lady
sometimes what you mean is 2 different things
depending on your mood if it swings think too many things
little hit of dre's weed i can do anything
catch a contact then i'm gone and i'm back
i speed write and my loose leaves my launch pad
and i can pull any string
don't have to prove anything
catch a contract on your head
you headed west talk shit about dre
you better get a vest then invest in something
to protect your head and neck
and it's back and forth all day like red and meth
i joke when i say i'm the best in the booth
but a lot of truth is said in jest
and if i ever do live to be a legend
i'ma die a sudden death 5 mics in the source
aingt holding my fucking breath
but i suffocate for the respect
fore i breathe to collect the fucking check
watch your fucking mouth
yo this timbaland tell him i said suck  my dick
'cause sometimes you just feel tired
feel weak and when you feel weak you feel like you wanna just give up
but you gotta search within you you gotta find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
and not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
yo left yo left yo left right left
till i collapse im spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
till the day that i drop you'll never say that i'm not killing them
'cause when i am not then i'ma stop pinning 'em
and i am not hip - hop and im just not eminem
subliminal thoughts when i'm stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop
amoxacillin is just not real enough
the criminal cop killing hip - hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners
you're coming with me feel it or not youre gonna fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us
you hear it a lot lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am i just a product of pop fizzing up
for shizzel my wizzel this is the plot listen up you bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a fuck
till the roof comes off till the lights go out
till my legs give out cant shut my mouth
till the smoke clears out am i high perhaps
i'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse
music is like magic theres a certain feeling you get when you're real
and you spit and people are feeling your shit
this is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
'cause you may never get it again
so while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'cause i'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in
i got a list here's the order of my list that it's in
it goes reggie jay - z tupac and biggie andre from outkast jada kurupt nas and then me
but in this industry i'm the cause of a lot of envy so when im not put on this list the shit does not offend me
that's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
even though half you people got a fucking problem with me
you hate it but you know respect youve got to give me
the press's wet dream like bobby and whitney nate hit me
soon as a verse starts i eat it at mcs heart
what is he thinking how not to go against me smart
and it's absurd how people hang on every word
ill probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but ill never be served my spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'cause in my heart of hearts i know nothing could ever be worse
thats why im clever when i put together every verse
my thoughts are sporadic i act like im an addict
i rap like im addicted to smack like im kim mathers
but i dont want to go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
so this is like a full blown attack im launching at them
the track is on some battling raps who want some static
'cause i dont really think that the fact that im slim matters
a plaque of platinum status is whack if i'm not the baddest so
until the roof
the roof comes off
until my legs
give out from underneath me
i will not fall
i will stand tall
feels like no one can beat me
hello boys and girls
today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
do you have a daddy
i'll bet you do
who's your daddy
daddy what're you doing
haha
ok then everybody listen up
i'm goin to hell who's coming with me

i think my dad gone crazy
there's no mountain i can't climb
there's no tower too high
no plane that i can't learn how to fly
what do i gotta do to get through to you to show you
there aingt nothing i can't take this chainsaw to
fucking braings brawn and brass balls
i cut 'em off i got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
inside of a hall with my framed autographed
sunglasses with elton john's name on my drag wall
i'm out the closet i been lying my ass off
all this time me and dre been fucking with hats off
suck it marshall
so tell laura and her husband to back off
before i push this motherfucking button and blast off
and launch one of these russians and that's all
blow every fucking thing except afghanistan on the map off
when will it stop when will i knock the crap off
hailie tell 'em baby
my dad's lost it
there's really nothing else to say i i can't explain it
a little help from hailie jade won't you tell em' baby
theres nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
there's no one on earth that can save me not even hailie
it's like my mother always told me
rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana
and codeine and goddamit you little motherfucker
if you aint got nothing nice to say then don't say nothing
uh
fuck that shit bitch eat a motherfucking dick
chew on a prick and lick a million motherfucking cocks per second
i'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
i'd rather be a pussy - whipped bitch eat pussy
and have pussy - lips glued to my face with a clit - ring in my nose
then quit bringin my flows quit giving me my ammo
can't you see why i'm so mean if y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my
mo
i wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
catch a homo by his toe man i don't know no more
am i the only fuckin one who's normal any more
dad
my songs can make you cry take you by surprise
and at the same time make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
see what you're seeing is a genius at work
which to me isn't work so it's easy to misinterpret it at first
cuz when i speak it's tongue in cheek
i'd yank my fuckin teeth before id ever bite my tongue
i'd slice my gums get struck by fucking lightning twice at once
and die and come back as vanilla ice's son
and walk around the rest of my life spit on
and kicked and hit with shit every time i sung
like r kelly as soon as bump n' grind comes on
more pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl inside of a
plane
aimed at the world trade standing on ronnie's grave
screaming at the sky till clouds gather as clyde mathers and bonnie jade
and thats pretty much the gist of itparents are pissed but the kids love
it
nine millimeter heater stashed in two - seaters with meat cleavers
i don't blame you i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither
crazy
you're funny daddy
is this thing on
where'd everybody go
back again
ken is back tell somemen

just let em' come to you
cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do
so let em' come to you
the rest of us follow suit
tweedle - de - tweedle - dum
if they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come
now here they come as we expected now we just set em' up
check - mate motherfucker
games over
we won
it doesnt take much
for me to raise such a stink up
when motherfuckers hate your guts
you aint even gotta say much
for me to put a pen to a blank sheet of papers
like smearing blood stains with a paint brush
i cant explain what it is my brain does
but however it works its insane
its plain nutz
and it aint just my brain thas dangerous
its a whole combination of things
it takes nutz
and im not affriad to raise the stakes up
i got a million bucks in the banks and 8 trucks
for anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
im patiently waiting for the day
im anxious
to see the look on ya fake mugs
when you thugs go bankrupt
ya drunk
ya aint tough
whatever you drank musta just turned ya into some gangstas
this is me talking motherfucker
this aint drugs
you wanna pop shit wake - up then make - up
fuck that
its too late chump now face up
i pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay does
opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off
or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
so i can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw
and give him the surgery that he came for
till i pull the paint off
i never been shot
but i think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth
cause ive always came off
like ja's chain
when they try to rush him and lost
and came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
i dont stop
the only thing i wait for
is day that i dont gotta report to probate court

yo we out
there's an intruder
in my house
he cut my phone - lines
can't dial out
i scream for police
but i doubt
they're gonna hear me
when i shout
a couple of cocktails will send me to jail
there's a couple of cops hot on my trail
but this time when i get pulled over
there's a doberman pincher and a pitbull in the seat
these pigs 'll get bit fooling with me
quit fooling with me
bitch you're gonna see
no pistol in the seat
why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
and which you're gonna see in the long run
im'a be the wrong one
you wanna harass with this limo tinted glass
flashing that flash - light on my ass where was you at
last night when them assholes
ran up on my grass
rapper slash actor
kiss the crack on my cracker slashed ass
they took away my right to bear arms
what i'm 'posed to fight with bare palms
yeah right
they coming with bombs i'm coming with flare - guns
we as americans
we as a americans
us as a citizen
gotta protect ourselves
look at how shit has been
we better check ourselves
living up in these streets
through worse and through better health
surviving by any means
we are samaritans
what do we get us in
take a look where you live
this is america
and we are americans
im'a make buku bucks
wearing buku vests
drama hanging over my head like a voodoo hex
i could've been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
but you know who
with an s tattooed to my chest
but i've finessed
now i got the industry pissy
ever since me and dre split it fifty - fifty on fifty it's funny
we got a buzz spreading quicker than making paper - airplanes out of a twenty
fuck money i don't rap for dead presidents
i'd rather see the president dead
it's never been said
but i set precedents and the standards
and they can't stand it
my name should've been bastard
the shit should've been plastered
on my forehead with a stamp
i should've been blasted
i should've been had a cap pulled in my ass
but i'm too swift and fast
for that i'm past it
i'm too old to go and cruise gratiot
fuck that shit
i done seen how fast this rap shit
can turn into some pap - pap shit
that quick
snap click
but this time they got fucking auto - ma - tic
 and no one gon' test this mon
clack
i got a secret if you can keep it between us
i tuck two nina's under my jeans either side of my penis
under my long johns
under my sean johns
when running with the long arm of the law i'm long gone
im'a do five years no less than that
no questions asked
it might be a good idea to stop right here
and quit while i'm ahead
already in the red
already got a steady infrared meant for my head
a target on my back
bigger problems than that
bin laden on my ass
he probably gone send a task
i aingt gone even ask
they aingt gone let me pack
they aingt gone gimme my semi but i got my whizz at
we are americans
we as samaritans
you still love me
take this 
you ready 1 2 3 
the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you don't want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's making me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
cause you love me and i love you more
it's sick but who could ever predict
we'd be doing the same shit
we say we do it for our baby but we don't
we do it for us it's lust
cause neither one of us trusts each other
so we fuck 'til we bust
then we cuss each other out
we know what it's about
shout 'til i throw you out the house
you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch
punch you in the mouth
fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
and apologize after
laughter pain it's insane
we're back in the same chapter again
and it's sad but it's true
when i'm laying here with you
there aingt nothing anyone could ever say ever do
cause i hate you do you hate me
good cause you're so fucking beautiful when you're angry
it makes me wanna just take you
and just throw you on the bed
and fuck you like i don't even know you
you fuck other people and i fuck other people
you a slut but i'm equal i'm a mutt
we're both evil in our ways
but neither one of us would ever admit it
cause one of us would have one up on the other
so forget it
we can make accusations people spread rumors
but they aingt got proof
'til they do it's just the two of us
it's you and me cause any chick can say that she's screwing me
but you gotta believe me to a degree
cause true indeed if you didn't i wouldn't be hitting it
yeah i would cause the sex is too damn good
if i ran who would i run to
that would be this soft and warm
so it's off and on usually more off than on
but at least we know that we share this common bond
you're the only one i can fuck without a condom on
i hope the only reason that i cope
is cause of that fact
and plus i can bust in that
and that's why
i could never understand it
that's why i don't try
from junior high until we both die
it's silly ho why must we try
is it really so rough
that we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff
try to pull each other's legs
until the other begs
we're lieing to ourselves
that's the beauty of it yeah
cause we truly love each other
that's why we always fight
and all we do is shove each other
every other fucking night
and it's clear it aingt gonna change
it's pent up rage
we both have
we both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else
we've both been
someone else's someone else
problem is neither one wants help
it's an addiction and it can't be fixed
our family's mixed up
there's a baby sister in the mix
and it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
and anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
and they're probably just tired of hearing it all the time
on every song every lyric and every rhyme
all the hoopla all of the whoopdy whoop
what you put me through fucking whoopdy doo
but i won't be made a fool of
if this is true love
you wouldn't do what
you did last time
you wouldn't screw up
this time
cause this time girl
i'm telling you what
you do it again i'm fucking you up
no matter what
what you say what you do
i'ma hunt you down 'til i find you
no matter where you run i'll be right there
right behind you in your nightmares
all the flowers and the candy
all the times that you threw it back at me
you told me you hate me you're gonna hate me more
when you find out can't escape me whore
uncle marshall
will you tell us a bedtime story
here we go
now once upon a time not long ago
there was a little rapper about to blow
but his album came and it was not good
i think it went lead or double copper wood
so the silly little fans they were mislead
by a nerdy internet computer hip - hop head
me and you 'clef we're gonna make some cash
grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass
hey mister would ya care to bare witness to
the ass - whipping i'm about to administer
to this ass - kissing little vaginal blister
stanabis little marshall mathers' sister
and in this corner we have the mister
not having it it's the mad sinister
dr evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick - sucking
ex - ll cool j fan from windsor
i'm 'bout to murder little kenny fag keniff - sta
you bastard i aingt wanna have to diss ya
canabis where the fuck you at i miss ya
can - i - bitch oh can - i - bitch
where for art thou can - i - bitch
please tell me what happened with
that style that you were rapping with
are you from los angeles
new york or just a janitor
from canada oh can - i - bitch
now at first i aingt really understand the shit
picture me for a second and imagine it
chilling in the bat - mansion and relaxing
when all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
it's can - i - bitch on some stan lives shit
it creeped me out at first man this is sick
for me being just a sick this conflict
gets my dick harder than arithmetic
and i know how you jealous ones envy
i shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
the first two letters you were telling me shit
like you respect me like any other regular mc
the third letter you ask how come i aingt return
none of the messages at shady records you left me 
the fourth letter: slim you really starting to upset me 
the fifth letter told me you were coming to get me 
the sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 
this crazy motherfucker's really trying to kill me 
so i went back and read the first few letters that said 
some shit about a message you left 
oh shit that's not an e that's an a 
this dude wants to leave me a massage he's gay 
right away i'm on the phone with dr dre 
we got a bogey  
from canada oh can - i - bitch 
so in two seconds flat dre's at my crib 
the funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 
and neither one of us have canadian citizenship 
shit oh dre wait a mintue that's it 
all we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
we can fly over the border let's go 
so we're off to toronto and we're gaining speed 
  jermaine dupri 
fuck it keep going no time to waste 
wait backup hit him one more time in case 
okay  fuck now he's dragging under the car 
oh well only 30 more thousand miles 
meanwhile me and dre are trying to conversate 
just trying to find a reason for the constant hate 
and trying to figure out what happened to 'germaine propaine' 
he couldn't have fell off that hard aingt no way 
what happened to the way you was rapping when you was scandalous 
that canibus turned into a television evangelist 
plus he raps with his regular voice 
  pet shop boys 
so we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
his corpse was still moving but his ass was rotted 
he kinda smelled a little like courtney love 
i figure if i stick him with a fork he's done 
so i stabbed him twice kept jabbing christ 
he won't die this guy's like a battered wife 
he's like kim he keeps coming back for more 
but he won't fight back i cracked his jaw 
hold up 'bis quit folding up 
punch me in the chest make my shoulders touch 
do something at least one punchline 
c'mon till the meter reads 9 - 9 - 9 - 
ty - nine percent of my fans are blonde 
'bis c'mon answer me man respond 
tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
intergalatical metaphors from mars 
raw to the floor raw like reservoir dogs 
bite another line from redman's song 
suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 
from a midget reaches out from under the car 
it's jd this motherfucker won't die neither 
dre starts spraying him with cans of ether 
we stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
 detroit bitch talk some shit again 
stomp him  stomp him  
dre alright he's dead dog quit kickin him 
i think stanabis jumped off the bridge again 
he disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 
yo check it out it's fucked up and i don't see either one of us budging
i'm withholding my anger
though i'd like to be the strangler
of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
it's my right to insist
that he acknowledge my existence
but he just displays complete lack of respect
that's what he says to himself
as he uses magazines to trash me
as he sits with both feet up at his desk
smokes a bag of his weed
and starts imagining things
and he just can't see that he's manically depressed
and in his jealousy and envy
it just whirls him in a frenzy
as he turns on mtv and sees my face
he don't exist in this world
so he just twists and he twirls
spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage
and it's destroying him slowly
cause he does not even know me
even though he sees me everywhere he goes
so he just tortures himself
he has no fortune and wealth
so he extorts someone else to get his dough
and now he's acting like a bully
so he tries to push and pull me
but he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
he has no choice but to scream
and raise his voice up at me
cause it annoys him to see that i aingt scared
you aingt no motherfucking 
and i aingt bowing to no motherfucking 
i won't allow it aingt gonna coward to no 
i'll be damned if i don't stand up to a 
fight like a man and throw my hands up to a 
and i know it must be fucking with you emotionall
now i'm not trying to make no more enemies
no more unfortunately
there's so many other motherfuckers that just are
they just keep pounding at me
now that i'm down with 50
suddenly now i got beef with this faggot ja' 
but his ass is such a puppet
irv could shove his whole hand up it
and just make him say what he wants him to say
but suge has irv's on a string
and irv's so nervous that he
says anything to this man to keep him at bay
so now ja thinks that he's so tough
and murder inc's the big bad wolf
and they go huff and puff and blow our label down
but our building's made out of bricks
so you aingt taking out shit
and dawg you just did a song with bobby brown
so now you try to pull a race card
and it backfires in your face hard
cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
plus this stylist that you fucked
when you was ecstasied up
was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch
you must be taking to much 
now what bothers me the most
about hip - hop is we so close
to picking up where we left off with big and pac
we just lost jam master j
big l got blasted away
plus we lost bugs slang toungue and freaky ta
it's like a never - ending cycle
that just seems to come full circle
everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
i'm not excluding myself
cause i been stupid as well
i been known to lose it when someone says something smart
but as we grow as men
we learn to let shit go but then again
there's only so much bullshit we can really stand
we all got reps to uphold
when someone steps on our toes
it's no exception it goes for every man
but if irv really gave a fuck
about ja like he claims he does
he'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
but he just keeps feeding him pills
so if that e doesn't kill him
someone from g - unit will and i aingt buzzed
dawg i'm talking to you straight
if the situation escalates
any worse we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
and if i get killed for this rap
i got a million in cash
that says i will get you back in halie's name
irvine get your boy off that 
get at me dawg
holla
good mornin
haha wake your mother fuckin asses up
yo what is the what
well come on then you know what time it is
stop sleepin on my roof bitch
for whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my arse whipped
cause i'ma have the last lift that ever gets arse squished
i just can't get past these little pissants
that wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
and they so mad they can't stand it
cause we can and they can't spit 
and they can't handle it like a man
and that's when it just happens
and i snap and it's a wrap and it's a scrap an then it isn't rap is it
hip - hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
maybe i'm old fashioned but my pashion 
is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin 
believe me i'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol when i'm pissed now
but it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
cause i'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it
cause if i get pushed over the edge then i'm pullin you with me
you poke a stick at a pitbull you get bit b
these words stick to you like crazy glue
when you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty
i'm the beatiful - est thing and your gonna miss me when i'm gone
like kieth murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci - dently

alright let's do it
let's go come on
lord please forgive me for what i do
for i know not what i've done
father please forgive me for i know not what i do
i just never had the chance to ever meet you
therefore i did not know that i would grow to be
my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
momma had a baby and it's head popped off 
my momma don't want me the next thing i know i'm getting dropped off
ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
but they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
 'til somebody finally took me in
my great aunt and uncle edna 'n charles 
they were the ones who were left in charge
my elementary they ganged up on me and sang this song
it went a little something like
mary had a little lamb little lamb little lamb
debbie had a satan spawn satan spawn
momma why do they keep saying this i just don't understand understand
and by the way where's my daaaaaaaaaaad
predominantly predominantly everything's always predominantly
predominantly white predominantly black but what about me
where does that leave me well i guess that i'm between predominantly
both of 'em i think if i hear that fucking word again i'mma scream
while i'm projectile vomiting what do i look like a comedian to you
do you think that i'm kidding what do i look like some kind of idi - 
wait a minute shit don't answer that  -  why am i so misunderstood
why do i go through so much bullshit it's such bullshit it's tush mull bisch
woe is me there goes poor marshall again whinin about his millions
and his mansion and his sorrow he's always drowning in
from the dad he never had and how his childhood was so bad
and how his mom was a dope addict and his ex - wife how they go at it
man i'd hate to have it as bad as that mr mathers claims he had it
i can't imagine it that little rich poor white bastard
needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
man if i only had half of it
shit if you only knew the half of it
evil deeds while i plant these evil seeds
please release me from these demons
i never had any of this shit planned mom please believe
i don't wanna be satan's spawn never got the chance to say i'm sorry
now look at all the pain i caused
dear santa claus why you not coming this year again
what did i do that was so bad to deserve this
everything could have been so perfect
but life aingt a fairytale i'm about to be hoisted up in the air
forty feet below me there's people everywhere
i don't even know why they feel like they know me cause i'm in this ferris wheel
and all i wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel
without this crowd everywhere i go but life is like a merry - go - round
here we go now doe - se - doe now curtains up the show must go
now ring around the rosie the show's over you can all go home now
but the curtain just don't close for me this aingt how fame is supposed to be
where's the switch i could just turn off and on this aingt what i chose to be
so please god give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'til i pass 50 back the baton the camera's on my soul is gone
there's not much you could do or say to phase me
people think i'm a little bit crazy
i get it from all angles even occasionally doc dre - zie'll
have to step in every once in a while to save me
to make me stop and think about it 'fore i just say things
sometimes i forget what other people just may think
a lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
if they heard some shit i'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me
i maybe a little too fast paced and racy
sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times
cuz i say so many rhymes it may seem like i'm goin too fast cuz my mind is racing
and i could give a fuck what category you place me
long as when i'm pushing up daisies and gone
as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
when i hit the heavenly gates i'll be cool beside jay - z
for every single die hard fan who embraced me
i'm thankful for the talent in which god gave me
and i'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
believe it or not i thank my mom for how she raised me
in the neighborhood daily they jumped and chased me
it only made me what i am today see
regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
you aingt gonna make or break me
tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake g
you're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
cuz sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
and when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me
you had all this time to think about it
now don't pussy out and try to about face me
cuz i've been patiently waiting for the day
that we finally meet in the same place to see
no matter how many battles i been in and won
no matter how many magazines on my nuts
no matter how many mc's i eat up
ooh ooh it's never enough
my flow's untouchable now you gotta face it
uh oh it gets worse when i go back to the basics
you go say the wrong shit and get your face split
the smell of victory love it so much i can taste it
i spot my target blaze it direct hit
graze it your peace talk save it
you shit sounds dated you're overrated
i'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers
if i'm the best and the worst then god's gift is a curse
soldier trained to destroy you paying attention boy
i spit shit slick shit so quick you miss it
to be specific i go ballistic as hieroglyphic
my music is a drug press play you aingt gotta sniff it
chew it or pop it roll a bag or chop it
get your high over and over but you gotta cop it
when it's hot it's hot
your hating is undeniable stop it
what we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough if you wish to be
saved not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls if or
which over we seem to be approaching an age of the gross we all have this idea that we should
move up from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better
come on let's cut the bullshit enough
let's get it started let's start addressing this issue and open it up
let's take this shit back to basement
and we can discuss statements thats made on this tape
and its whole origin of the music that we all know and love
the music that we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of tryna destroy
let's rewind it to 89 when i was a boy on the east side of detroit
crossing 8 mile into warren into hick territory
i'd like to share a story this is my story and cant no body tell it for me
you will well inform me i am well aware that i don't belong here
you've made that perfectly clear i get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
from bel - air shopping center just for stopping in there
from the black side all the way to the white side
ok there's a bright side a day that i might slide
you may call it a past i call it hauling my ass
through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
oh them railroad tracks them old railroad tracks
them good old notorious oh well known tracks
so lets go back
follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
i once used to call home sweet home
i roam the streets so much they call me a drifter
sometimes i stick up a thumb just to hitch hike
just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 mile and van dyke
and steal a god damn bike from somebody's backyard
and drop it off at the park that was the half way mark
to meet kim had to walk back to her mama's on chalmers after dark
to sneak me in the house when i'm kicked out my mom's
thats about the time i first met proof with goofy gary on the steps
at osbourne handing out some flyers he was doing some talent shows
at centerline high i had told him to stop by and check this out sometime
he looked at me like i'm out my mind shook his head like white boys don't know how to rhyme
i spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
and we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
we was on the same shit that big daddy kane shit with compound syllables sound combined
from that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line
my first year in 9th grade can't forget that day at school
it was cool till your man mc shan came through
and said that puma's the brand 'cause the clan makes troops
it was rumors but man god damn they flew
must've been true because man we done banned they shoes
i had the new ones the cool j ice land swayed too
and we just through them in the trash like they yesterday's news
guess who came through next x - clan debut
professor x vanglorious exists in a state of red black and green
with a key sissies now with this being a new trend
we don't fit in crackers is out with cactus albums
blackness is in african symbols and medallions
represents black power and we aingt know what it meant
me and my man howard and butter we would go to the mall with 'em
all over our necks like we're showing 'em off not knowing at all
we was being laughed at you aingt even half black
you aingt supposed to have that homie let me grab that
and that flavor flave clock we gonna have to snatch that
all i remember is meeting back at manix's basement
saying how we hate this how racist but dope the x clan's tape is
which reminds me back in 89 me and kim broke up for the first time
she was tryna two time me and there was this black girl
at our school who thought i was cool cause i rapped so she was kinda eyeing me
and oh the irony guess what her name was aingt even gonna say it plus
the same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
the bombest god damn girl in our whole school if i could pull it
not only would i become more popular but i would be able to piss kim off at the same time
but it backfired i was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
and thats the last i ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl
but i've heard people say they heard the tape and it aingt that bad
but it was i singled out a whole race and for that apologize
i was wrong cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a hoe
step by step heart to heart left right left
we all fall down
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit torn apart we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers
i'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
i aingt never supposed to show it my crew aingt supposed to know it
even if it means going toe to toe with a benzino it don't matter
i'd never drag them in battles that i can handle unless i absolutely have to
i'm supposed to set an example
i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide 'em
if some shit ever does pop off i'm supposed to be beside 'em
that ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
there's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
i heard him say hailie's name on a song and i just lost it
it was crazy this shit went way beyond some jay - z and nas shit
and even though the battle was won i feel like we lost it
i spent too much energy on it honestly i'm exhausted
and i'm so caught in it i almost feel i'm the one who caused it
this aingt what i'm in hip - hop for it's not why i got in it
that was never my object for someone to get killed
why would i wanna destroy something i help build
it wasn't my intentions my intentions were good
i went through my whole career without ever mentioning
and that was just out of respect for not running my mouth
and talking about something that i knew nothing about
plus dre told me stay out this just wasn't my beef
so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
while he's all over tv down talking a man who literally saved my life
like fuck it i understand this is business
and this shit just isn't none of my business
but still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute cause
there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
and wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
but now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets escalated it aingt just words no more is it
it's a different ball game calling names and you aingt just rapping
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happening
me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
until ja started yapping in magazines how we stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash 'em mash 'em and let him have it
meanwhile my attention is pulling in other directions
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
has an erection for me and thinks that i'll be his resurrection
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways i came up
was through that publication the same one that made me famous
now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothing
well fuck it that motherfucker can get it too fuck him then
but i'm so busy being pissed off i don't stop to think
that we just inherited 50's beef with murder inc
and he's inherited mine which is fine aingt like either of us mind
we still have soldiers that's on the front line
that's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
never to extort us strictly to show they support us
we'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
to show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
to have runyan avenue soldiers up in our corners
their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
but i aingt tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
it aingt worth it i can't think of a perfecter way to word it
then to just say that i love ya'll too much to see the verdict
i'll walk away from it all before i let it go any further
but don't get it twisted it's not a plea that i'm copping
i'm just willing to be the bigger man
if ya'll can quit popping off at the jaws well then i can
cause frankly i'm sick of talking
i'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause
i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america
and to the republic for which it stands
one nation under god
indivisible with liberty and justice for all
it feels so good to be back
i scrutinize every word memorize every line
i spit it once refuel re - energize and rewind
i give sight to the blind my insight through the mind
i exercise my right to express when i feel it's time
it's just all in your mind what you interpret it as
i say to fight you take it as i'mma whip someone's ass
if you don't understand don't even bother to ask
a father who has grown up with a fatherless past
who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
or at least shows no difficulty multi - task
and in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft
slash entrepreneur who has helped launch a few more rap acts
who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
of his career typical manure moving past that
mr kisses ass crack he's a class act
rubber band man yea he just snaps back
come along follow me as i lead through the darkness
as i provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
carry on give me hope give me strength
come with me and i won't steer you wrong
put your faith and your trust as i guide us through the fog
to the light at the end of the tunnel
we gonna fight we gonna charge we gonna stomp we gonna march
through the swamp we gonna mosh through the marsh
take us right through the doors 
all the people up top on the side and the middle
come together lets all bomb and swamp just a little
just let it gradually build from the front to the back
all you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
don't matter what color all that matters we gathered together
to celebrate for the same cause don't matter the weather
if it rains let it rain yea the wetter the better
they aingt gonna stop us they can't we stronger now more than ever
they tell us no we say yea they tell us stop we say go
rebel with a rebel yell raise hell we gonna let em know
stomp push shove mush fuck bush until they bring our troops home 
imagine it pouring it's raining down on us
mosh pits outside the oval office
someone's tryina tell us something
maybe this is god just saying we're responsible
for this monster this coward
that we have empowered
this is bin laden look at his head nodding
how could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
now this is our final hour
let me be the voice in your strength and your choice
let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
try to amplify the times it and multiply by six
teen million people are equal at this high pitch
maybe we can reach alqueda through my speech
let the president answer a higher anarchy
strap him with an ak - 47 let him go fight his own war
let him impress daddy that way
no more blood for oil we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
no more psychological warfare to trick us to thinking that we aingt loyal
if we don't serve our own country we're patronizing a hero
look in his eyes its all lies
the stars and stripes they've been swiped washed out and wiped
and replaced with his own face mosh now or die
if i get sniped tonight you know why
cause i told you to fight
and as we proceed
to mosh through this desert storm
in these closing statements if they should argue
let us beg to differ
as we set aside our differences
and assemble our own army
to disarm this weapon of mass destruction
that we call our president for the present
and mosh for the future of our next generation
to speak and be heard
mr president mr senator
do you guy's hear ushear us 
there i go -  - thinking of you again
you don't know how sick you make me
you make me fucking sick to my stomach
every time i think of you i puke
you must just not know -  - whoa - whoa - whoa - whoa
you may not think you do but you do
i was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
but off of the dome would probably be a little more more suitable for this type of song -  - whoa
i got a million reasons off the top of my head that i could think of
sixteen bars this aingt enough to put some ink ta
so fuck it i'ma start right here i'll just be brief i'm
bout to rattle off some of the reasons
i knew i shouldn't go and get another tattoo of you
on my arm but what do i go and do
i go and get another one now i got two
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
now i'm sitting here with your name on my skin
i can't believe i went and did this stupid shit again
my next girlfriend now her name's gotta be kim
shi - ii - ii - ii - ii - ii - it
if you only knew how much i hated you
for every motherfucking thing you ever put us through
then i wouldn't be standing here crying over you
boo - oo - oo - oo - oo - oo - who
i was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
but i thought a song would probably be a little better
instead of a letter
that you'd probably just shred up -  - yeah
i stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
how much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta a stupid piece a
paper i'd rather let you see how
much i fucking hate you in a freestyle
you're a fucking coke - head slut i hope you fucking die
i hope you get to hell and satan sticks a needle in your eye
i hate your fucking guts you fucking slut i hope you die
di - ii - ii - ii - ii - ii - ie
but please don't get me wrong i'm not bitter or mad
it's not that i still love you it's not 'cause i want you back
it's just that when i think of you it makes me wanna
gag - aa - aa - aa - aa - aa - aa - ag
what else can i do i haven't got a clue
now i guess i'll just move on i have no choice but to
but every time i think of you now all i wanna do
is pu - uu - uu - uu - uu - uu - uke
fucking bitch

uh listen i just got a call from the label
and you're probably not gonna be surprised but um
michael jackson is extremely upset about the 'just lose it' video
and um i mean he's pissed so i - i don't know what he's gonna do
but we gotta talk about how we're gonna handle this um
oh yeah anyway somebody told me that um they heard a rumor that you got a new gun um
i know it's probably not true but i just need to talk to you about that
so uh give me a call 
yeah yeah
you find me offensive i find you offensive
for finding me offensive
hence if i should draw the line on any fences
if so to what extent
if at any should i go
'cause it's getting expensive
being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
they say i cause extensive
psychological nerve damage to the brain when i go to lengths this
far at other peoples' expenses
i say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
it's censorship
and it's down right blasphemous
let's end this shit now 'cause i won't stand for this
and christopher reeves won't sit for this neither
and let's clear this up too i aingt got no beef with him either
he used to be like a hero to me
i even believe i had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
right next to darth vader
and darth must have put a hex on him for later
i feel like it's my fault 'cause of the way that
i stuck him up in between him and lex luthor
i killed superman i killed super -  - man
and how ironic that i'd be the bad guy
kryptonite: the green chronic
'cause i aingt got no legs
or no brain nice to meet you
hi my name is
i forgot my name
my aim was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
rain man
now in the bible it says
thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
have homosexual sex
unless of course you were given the consent to join in
then of course it's intercourse
and it's bi - sexual sex
which isn't as bad as long as you show some remorse for your actions
either before during or after performing the act of that which
is normally referred to have such more commonly known phrases
that are more used by today's kids
in a more derogatory way but
who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say
let's ask dr dre
dr dre 
i gotta question if i may 
is it gay to play putt - putt golf with a friend 
and watch his butt - butt when he tees off 
but up i aingt done yet
in football the quarterback yells out hutt - hutt
while he reaches in another grown man's ass
grabs on his nuts but just what if
it was never meant it was just an accident
but he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in
his teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
but his little weenie flinched just a little bit
and i don't mean to go in into any more details but
what if he pictured it as a females butt
is that gay i just need to clear things up
'til then i'll just walk around with a manly strut because
shit this is the same verse i just did this
when am i gonna come to my good senses
probably the day bush comes to my defenses
my spider sense is telling me spiderman is nearby
and my plan is to get him next
and open up a whip - ass canister
goddamn it dre where's the god damn beat 
anyway anyway i don't know how else to put it
this is the only thing that i'm good at
i am the bad guy kryptonite: the green chronic
demonic yep yep don't worry i'm on it
i got it high five nick lachey
stuck a pin in jessica's head and walked away
and as she flew around the room like a balloon
i grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
out the trash can and zoom
i headed straight back to the neverland ranch
with a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
and i aingt even gotta make no god damn sense
i just did a whole song and i didn't say shit
cause iiiaaaaaaaahhhhhhhahahaaa aaaaahahhhhhhhhhh
yo rain man
definitely definitely dr dre super dope beat maker two thousand and
two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
nine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three
and seventy 
i don't understand
why are you being so mean
you're mean mean man
you are just jealous of me
cuz you you just can't do what i do
so instead of just admitting it
you walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things
about me cuz you're a meanie a meanie
but it's only cuz you're
just really jealous of me
cuz i'm what you want to be
so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things
cuz it's too easy to see
you're really just a big weenie big weenie
alright listen i need you to focus
i need you to go dig deep in your mind this is important
we are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
i'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
now i need you to open your mind - your eyes close them
you are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
for the next four and a half minutes
we are going to explore into your mind
to find out why you're so fucking jealous
now why did they make yoo - hoo
hippity ga - ga boo - boo
psych i'm kidding
i just wanted to see if you're still listening
ok now i need your undivided attention
sir i have a question
why do i always sense this undeniable tension
from the moment that i enter into the room
it gets all quiet and whispers
whenever theres conversation why am i always mentioned
i've been dying to ask it's been itching at me
is it just because
alright now i i just flubbed a line
i was going to say something extremely important
but i forgot who or what it was i fucked up
psych i'm kidding again you idiot no i didn't
that's just what you wanted to hear from me
is that i fucked up aingt it
but i can bust one take without looking at no paper
it doesn't take a bunch of takes
or me to stand here in this booth all day
for me to say the truth ok
you're droolin you have tooth decay
your mouth is open you're disgusting
what the fuck you eat for lunch
a bunch of sweets or something what
you munch a bunch of crunch 'n munch
your tooth is rotten to the gum
your breath stinks wanna chew some gum
yes i do sir what am i on
you sir are on truth syrum
marshall i'm so jealous of you
please say you won't tell nobody
i'd be so embarrassed i'm just absolutely terrified
that someone's gonna find out why i'm saying
all these terrible evil and awful mean things
it's my own insecurity
alright now we we're going to conduct
that experiment that we were talking about earlier
just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
cuz that's exactly what your eyes look like want to check to see
here's a mirror notice the resemblence here
wait let me put these sun glasses on
now look in this mirror how about now
what do you have in common
you're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
you look like i sound like singing about weenies
now take my weenie out of your mouth
this is between me and you i know you're not happy
i know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
curled up in a ball tweeked out of my mind dying
there is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
why you even doing this to yourself it's pointless
why do we have to keep on going through this this is tortuous
my point is this
that if you say mean things weenie will shrink
now i fogot what the chorus is your just is
aye yo paul it's em
i got your call about the michael jackson thing
and i know that he's not 'thrilled' about the video
what does he 'wanna be starting something'
well i'll show him who's really 'bad'
paul 'the way you make me feel' with these calls
you should really take a look at the 'man in the mirror'
and tell him to 'beat it' because i 'won't stop till i get enough'
do you 'remember the time' we were watching the 'billy jean' video
well he'll always be that michael to me
and it doesn't matter if he's 'black or white'
because i 'can't stop loving him' and i hate plastic surgeons
and i hope they all fucking die
how do you like that
and i like him i like him a lot
i want to touch him but i can't
excuse me i'm taking a shit

what the fuck is wrong with you 
if there's any bitches in this room then there's something i gotta say
for all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
i've been down that road and now i'm back sitting on square one
tryna pick myself up where i started from
i never woulda thought that i'd see you outta control
even though my penis was deep down in your hole
you should know between us we was like mates to soul
nothing could intervene us especially no hoes
you was more so the chalant type i chose
to more shows haunted you nights i suppose
that's how it go with time spent emotion grows
in the beginning friends we decided to roll
so who's responsible when you get excited explode
and obie's grinning then you invite that obie's cold
but bitches the gon' talk niggas they gon' hate
we established this way before we became mates
so whats required is that you chill with all that fire
get your desire when i retire
spend some time with me say that you'll be mine
i never thought i'd find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right cuz you just crossed the line
i used to say i never met a girl like you before
still aingt got a fucking clue as to who you truly are
almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
till you went as far as going and snooping through my drawers
now i just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
can't believe i almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
you used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
all i ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
if you recall i used to treat you as a groupie broad
when we fucked i refused to even take my jewelry off
but it threw me off the first time i called and you blew me off
it was a shock it struck me as odd but it turned me on
you started getting moody on me pretty soon we'd argue
and the ruder you got the more beautiful you got to me
and who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly
cupid could shoot another one of them god damn darts at me
it's true that i got shot in the heart
but when someone seems too good to be true they usually are
but see when you're in it it's too hard to see
till you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
before you make a decision that's life altering
and just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
you hear them words echoing almost haunting that taunting ring
in most cases stat's attitude is fuck - a - bitch
my only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
but you was different thought we shared a covenant
even held your hand in public we suffering because of this
shorty on some whole 'notha other shit
tryna play sick thinking i'mma trick off rick
i'll admit i was caught in the mix down to commit
feed you the best of me i shoulda fed you piss
we started off closer than close
but who coulda predicted to know your trifling ways woulda stopped our growth
and the final result back in that same boat
i ask myself do i love these hoes no
em introduced us 50 this is tanya tanya this is 50
then slid off and left her to kick it with me
i complimented her i said you have very nice lips
with my imagination i could see her sucking my dick
we played the phone game a week later shit changed fast
had her coming over in a cab to give me some ass
downtown manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
penthouse full of imported shit you know how i grind
she got to talking talking like an opportunist too
why talk when sucking my dick is the real career move
said she's an inspiring actress she do videos for practice
yeah yeah know how many times i done heard that shit
i know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
but hey what daddy always tell you
straighten up little soldier
stiffen up that upper lip
what you crying about
you got me
hailie i know you miss your mom and i know you miss your dad
when i'm gone but i'm trying to give you the life that i never had
i can see you're sad even when you smile even when you laugh
i can see it in your eyes deep inside you want to cry
'cause you're scared i aingt there
daddy's with you in your prayers
no more crying wipe them tears
daddy's here no more nightmares
we gon' pull together through it we gon' do it
lainie uncle's crazy aingt he
yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
we're all we got in this world
when it spins when it swirls
when it whirls when it twirls
two little beautiful girls
looking puzzled in a daze
i know it's confusing you
daddy's always on the move mamma's always on the news
i try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that the more it backfires on me
all the things growing up as daddy that he had to see
daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
we did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
but things have got so bad between us
i don't see us ever being together ever again
like we used to be when we was teenagers
but then of course everything always happens for a reason
i guess it was never meant to be
but it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
but no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
now hush little baby don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up little lady i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night
i know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
we feel how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy pretty baby
but i promise mama's gon' be alright
it's funny
i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up
and stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
i'll never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night crying
'cause daddy felt like a bum see daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time every house that we lived in
either kept getting broken into and robbed
or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your mamma's heart
and it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
mom and dad was arguing a lot so momma moved back
on the chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara
and that's when daddy went to california with his cd and met dr dre
and flew you and momma out to see me
but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me
then you started seeing daddy on the tv and momma didn't like it
and you and lainnie were too young to understand it
papa was a rolling stone momma developed a habit
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
i'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now i'm sitting in this empty house just reminiscing
looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown it's almost like you're sisters now
wow i guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
lainnie i'm talking to you too daddy's still here
i like the sound of that yeah
it's got a ring to it don't it
shh mama's only gone for the moment
and if you ask me to
daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
i'mma give you the world
i'mma buy a diamond ring for you
i'mma sing for you
i'll do anything for you to see you smile
and if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
i'mma break that birdie's neck
i'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
and make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad 
i tell myself that i'm doing alright
nothing else to do tonight but
to go crazy crazy on you
lemme go crazy crazy on you
youuuuuuuuu
can't you see what you do to me baby
you make me crazy you make me act like a maniac
i'm like a lunatic you make me sick
you truly are the only one who can do this to me
you just make me get so crazy
i go skitzo i get so insane i just go skitzophrenic
one minute i want to slit your throat
the next i want to sex
you make me crazy
the way we act like 2 maniacs in the sac
we fuck like 2 jackrabbits
and maybe that's a bad habit
cuz the next day we're right back at it
in the same exact pattern
what the fuck is the matter with us
we can't figure out if it's
lust or it's love
what's sad is what's attracting us to each other
they say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch
but i stay and still stick it out with you even though i just hit you today
but you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
just cuz i came home late last night crawled in bed and i woke you
but if there's one thing about you i admire its baby
because you stay with me maybe because you're as crazy as i am
cuz when i look at you i can see an angel in your eyes
but if i look deeper inside i see your freakish little side
like a devil in disguise
you're always full of surprises
always pulling devises
out your purse little vibrators and dildos
you fucked yourself so much
you barely feel those anymore
you're only 24 but you're plenty more mature
than those other little hoes
who just act like little girls
like they're in middle school still
you're crazy sexy cool chillin
you play your position
you never step out of line
even though i stay in your business
you've always kept out of mine
i wonder whats on your mind
sometimes they say love is blind
maybe that's why the first time i dotted your eye
you aingt see a sign
or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved
maybe cuz we're crazy in loooove
crazy on you
let me go crazy crazy on youuuuuuuuu
you're the ink to my paper
where my pen is to my pad
the moral the very fiber
the whole substance to my rap
you are my reason for being
the meaning of my existence
if it wasn't for you
i would never be able to spit this
as intense i do and the irony
is you rely on me as much
as i rely on you to inspire me like you do
you provide me the lighter fluid to fuel my fire
you're my entire supply
gas the match the igniter
the only way that i am able to stay so stable
is you're the legs to my table
if you were to break i'd fall on my face
but i'm always going to make you feel
i don't need you as much as i really need you
so you don't use it to your advantage
but you're essential to me
you're the air i breathe
i believe if you ever leave me
i'd probably have no reason to be
you are the kim to my marshall
you're the slim to my shady
the dre to my eminem
the elaina to my hailey
you are the word i am looking for when
i'm trying to describe how i feel inside
and the right one just won't come to my mind
you're like the pillar that props me up
the beam that supports me
the bitch who never took half
the wife who never divorced me
you're like the root to my evil
you let my devil come out me
you let me beat the shit out you
before you beat the shit out me
and no matter how much
too much is never enough
i'm crazy on you
i told ya'll motherfuckers i was coming back
what now nigga what now what

security's gone i'm dropped in the club
and i'm tryna run and get my motherfucking gun

these niggas is tripping
i'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wilding
two minutes ago we was all joking and smiling
this chick is clinging onto me sobbing and sighing
saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she crying
but it's real and it's on and cats is getting killed
so i hugged her and used her body as a human shield
and she got hit now she yelling
i told her i'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
i squeezed through the back door and made my escape
i ran and got my 38 i hope its not to late
i'm on seven mile what the fuck was that
damn somebody hit me from the back
with a gat nigga and my tire flat
and i just hit a pole them niggas some hoes

and i'mma park my car and walk the rest of the way
i'm in the mood to strut my ak aingt even tucked
i'm gonna meet you at the club we're gonna fuck these hoes up
i've never seen no shit like this in my life before
people are still camped out from the night before
sleeping outside the door waiting in line
still tryna get inside the club to see d12 perform
the fire marshals know the venue's too small
people are wall to wall three thousand and some odd fans
and some cum wad from out the parking lot
gets in an argument over a parking spot
decides to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off
missed who he's aiming for six feet away's the door
into the same entrance hall now the strays flying all over the place
grazed one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall
before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
i'm posted up by the bar having a mazel tov
bullet whizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
thank god i'm alive i gotta find a nine
and where the fuck is von he usually tucks one on him
wait a minute i think i just saw bizarre
nah i guess not what the fuck oh my god it was
i never saw him run so fast in my life
look at him hauling ass i think he left his wife
there she is on the ground being trampled
i go to grab her up by the damn hand but i can't pull her
god damn there just went another damn bullet i'm hit
my vest is barely able to handle it it's too thin
if i get hit again i can't do it i scoop dee
follow bizarre's path and ran through it
made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
looked up and i seen swift shooting it out
but i can't see who he's shooting it out with
but denaun's right behind him squeezing his four fifth
it's friday night came to this bitch right
big ass in my left hand desert eagle in my right
i aingt come in this bitch to party i came in this bitch to fight
although i can't stay here to fight 'cause i'm popping niggas tonight
that's right bitches i'm drunk with revenge
shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when i get in
swift told me to meet him here so it's clear that this fucker
shoot out the back of his truck goes up in this motherfucker
so one shot for the money two's to stop the show
third's for the bartender there's plenty of shots to go
he tried to run so proof shot him in the knee with a three piece
sh - sh - sh - shady
aftermath haha
g - g - g - g - g - unit haha
cause we came here to set this party off right
let's bounce tonight
and if they don't let us in through the front
we'll come through the side
cuz i don't ever wanna leave the game without
at least saying goodbye
so all my people on the left all my people on the right
swing one last time
get your ass up for the doctor
one more time get your ass up for the doctor
come on now here we go
cliff hanger it's another club banger
got you hanging on the edge of your seat
get on down
times up games over you lose i win
'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
ooh yeah new year next phase begin
look who's got you going crazy again
i'm a trend i set one every time i'm in
i go out and just come back full circle again
you a fad that means your something that we already had
but once you're gone you don't come back too bad
you're off the map now radar can't even find you
we stay on the grind you slip we out - grind you
you walk around mad you let your anger blind you
we walk around just playing the violin behind you
enough with all the pissing and moaning whining and bitching
sit and observe listen you'll learn if you pay attention
why ten multi - platinum albums later three diamond
world - wide we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbing
when dr dre say crunk you will get it crunk get it crunk
crunk crunk crunk
and when 50 cent says jump you get on one foot and jump
jump jump jump jump
the buzz is tremendous we drop you all to sense it
i don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
we keep the party rocking off the henges
we aingt showing off we just going off popular consensus
but critics say that doc is soft doc is talk
doc is all washed up knock it off
who the fuck is doc impressing
doc is this doc is that you got the wrong impression
you must be on the cock of doc cuz doc left you all guessing
so dj take the needle and just drop it on the record 
we gon' have this mutherfucker hopping in a second 
that's why we always save the best cut last
to make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
cuz we done swam with the sharks wrestle with alligators
spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
maybe raised to be racist
who may have never got to see our faces
grace the cover of rolling stone pages
broke down barriers of language and races
just call on the cape crusaders
and leave it to me and dre to pass the mic
and we can play the back and forth all day
like the hot potato game thats why we came to
50 cent come on
bounce now hands up you know how we do
we make the club jump everywhere we go
it's no secret everybody know
when dre's involved there's plenty money involved
and plenty honey's involved the sunny sunday's and palm trees
cali everyday it's just another party from the valley's
all the way to them 8 mile alleys let's rally
hands up for the grand finale
now raise up out your seat dre is about to speak
blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
you could catch me in the studio banging out the beats to
provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speaker
so never say never cuz shady aftermath together
along with g - unit records presents the return of the - the doc 
no one could do it better
we tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
yeah haha
still aftermath 2006
and don't worry about that detox album
it's coming we gonna make dre do it haha
50 cent g - unit obie trice d - twizzy stat quo dr dre
we aingt leaving let's go haha
ladies and gentlemen thank you all for coming out peace
oh shit i almost forgot
you're coming with me 
haha bye bye
see you in hell fuckers
once you call my name out things will never be the same
they should have never let us get off foot in this game
ever since i was introduced to rap music
i been missing a screw like bishop and juice
i could lose it at any moment
those who know me know it
so they're probably told you go with the flow
just so that i don't explode
and have another episode where i let it go as far as
the one with benzino did i'm waiting for that next beef
i'm cocked locked and loaded
i'm ready to go so bad i'm going bananas
my dick's so hard anna nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with
oh shit i mean when she was still bloated
before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it
anybody i throw flames at gets a name it's a game
cause they know that they don't spit the same
it's a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame
everyday it's the same thing
people in this game try to buddy buddy us
just to get close enough to study us
everybody just wants to have something to do with that
they all trying to get that stamp
they after that shady  -  aftermath money
it's like a monopoly
they probably just now finally understand how to rob fully
50 cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
and dre it's like we hit the fucking lottery
and a damn slot machine at the same time as each other
why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
when we rhyme with each other
in time we discovered that we have more in common
then we thought with each other
both robbed of our mothers
our fathers aingt want us
what was wrong with us was it our fault
cause we started thinking god doesn't love us
two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
what a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in jamaica queens
i still remember the call up in 
big l had just got popped just a month before
if 50 lives he's getting dropped from columbia
two years later me and doc had to come and uh operate
that's when he popped up a number one
and we aingt never gonna stop if you wond - ering
even if i'm under the gun
you aingt gotta agree all the time with me
or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and i
but see the difference is if it is i could give a shit
still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
ego's aside fore i bruise em' all
swallow your pride fore i step on it with shoes you call nike's
earth links how do you like these you gotta love them
look at the bottom of em' they're like cleats
stomping i been romping since tim dogg was hollering
'fuck compton'
i was whiling free styling back when they was still making maxell cassettes
i wasn't even raps elvis yet

look if you had one shot or one opportunity
to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
would you capture it or just let it slip
yo
his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
there's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti
he's nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs
but he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down
the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth but the words won't come out
he's choking how everybody's joking now
the clock's run out time's up over blaow
snap back to reality oh there goes gravity
oh there goes rabbit he choked
he's so mad but he won't give up that
easy no
he won't have it he knows his whole back's to these ropes
it don't matter he's dope
he knows that but he's broke
he's so stagnant he knows
when he goes back to his mobile home that's when it's
back to the lab again yo
this whole rhapsody
he better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
you better lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go 
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
the soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
this world is mine for the taking
make me king as we move toward a new world order
a normal life is boring but superstardom's close to postmortem
it only grows harder homie grows hotter
he blows it's all over these hoes is all on him
coast to coast shows he's known as the globetrotter
lonely roads god only knows
he's grown farther from home he's no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
his hoes don't want him no more he's cold product
they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nose dove and sold nada
so the soap opera is told and unfolds
i suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
da da dum da dum da da da da
no more games i'mma change what you call rage
tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
i was playing in the beginning the mood all changed
i've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i can't get by with my 9 to 5
and i can't provide the right type of life for my family
'cause man these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
and it's no movie there's no mekhi phifer this is my life
and these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
trying to feed and water my seed plus
teeter totter caught up between being a father and a primadonna
baby mama drama's screaming on her
too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot another day of monotony's gotten me
to the point i'm like a snail
i've got to formulate a plot or i end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfucking option failure's not
mom i love you but this trailer's got to go
i cannot grow old in salem's lot
so here i go it's my shot
feet fail me not
this may be the only opportunity that i got
you can do anything you set your mind to man

the older i get the dumber the shit i get in
the more ignorant the incident is i fit in
ignoring the shit how boring it gets
when there's no one to hit
i don't know when to quit throwing a fit
i know i'm a bit flaky but they make me
it's they who raised me and say the can take me

'till i walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
but still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
over reaction is my only reaction
which only sets off a chain reaction
and puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action
a rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
nine millimeters five criminals pulling heaters
and spilling liters of blood like swimming pools
shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too 
a lot of people say misoginistic which is true
i can't deny it matter of fact i stand by it
so please stand by it before we start up a damn riot
if you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
boy girl dog woman man child
i will sit on you i don't care who you are
motherfuckers say that i'm foolish i only talk about jewels
do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it
see i'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
that same dude you gave nothing i made something doing
what i do through and through and i gave you the news with a twist it's just his ghetto point of view
the renegade you been afraid
i penetrate pop culture bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they
pop toasters and they live with their mums
got dropped roasters from botched robberies niggas crotched over
mummy's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over
knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
no he's not around now how that sound to ya jot it down
i'll bring you through the ghetto without riding round
hiding down ducking strays from frustrated youths stuck in their ways
just read a magazine that fucked up my day
how you rate music that thugs with nothing relate to it
i help them see they way through it not you
can't step in my pants can't walk in my shoes
bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt
since i'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i aingt no politician but i'll kick it within a minute
cause see they call me a menace and if the shoe fits i'll wear it
but if it don't then ya'll swallow the truth grin and bear it
now who's the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
using his music to steer it sharing his views and his merits
but there's a huge interference they're saying you shouldn't hear it
maybe it's hatred i spew maybe it's food for the spirit
maybe it's beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but i'm debated disputed hated and viewed in america
as a motherfucking drug addict like you didn't experiment
now now that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrassed
and i got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fucking do - gooders  -  too bad you couldn't do - good at marriage
and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here i don't
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
cause here we go he's 
and i'm the sinister mr kiss - my - ass it's just the
renegade never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at any given time of day
cause i'm a renegade never been afraid to talk
about anything  anything  renegade
never been afraid to say
cause i'm a  never been afraid to holler
about anything  anything 
i had to hustle my back to the wall ashy knuckles
pockets filled with a lot of lint not a cent
gotta vent lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench
what you hollering gotta pay rent bring dollars in
by the bodega iron under my coat feeling braver
doo - rag wrapping my waves up pockets full of hope
do not step to me i'm awkward i box leftier often
my pops left me and often my momma wasn't home
could not stress to me i wasn't growing especially on nights
i brought something home to quiet the stomach rumblings
my demeanor thirty years my senior
my childhood didn't mean much only raisin greener
raising my fingers to critics raising my head to the sky
big i did it multi before i die 
no lie just know i chose my own fate
i drove by the fork in the road and went straight
see i'm a poet to some a regular modern day shakespeare
jesus christ the king of these latter day saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate satan and scatter - brained atheist
but that aingt the case see it's a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shady's as bad as they say he is
or is he the ladder a gateway to escape
media scapegoat they can be mad at today
see it's as easy as cake simple as whistling dixie
while i'm waving the pistol at sixty christians against me
go to war with the mormons take a bath with the catholics
in holy water no wonder they try to hold me under longer
i'm a motherfucking spiteful delightful eyeful
the new ice cube motherfuckers hate to like you
what did i do  i'm just a kid from the gutter
making his butter off these bloodsuckers cause i'm a motherfucking
shady we're back
nothing can stop and nothing can change it
you better just make new living arrangements
if you think your the top and king of the castle
you about to get thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
all i hear is i'm best at this an i'm best at that
but i don't hear my name no man brought up in rap
and i don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
but when they say one of the best i'm nowhere thought of as that
not even the same league as jay - z
nas pac biggie or maybe they'll name me
somewhere down at the bottom right after az
or say he ripped that biggie verse or that jay - z
yo his verses were crazy on that renegade beat
but i aingt never bought no whole cd of shady
and i all i hear is pop tunes come on the rad - i - o
and they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
and that very well may be the same reason they don't say me
when they speak on hip - hop legends which has amazed me
cause i thought the formula was to hit mainstream
and make it big - big - big - big - b - baby
so maybe the 80's made me crazy i been trying to get my weight
up since the a slim shady gave me the gate key paid the ways
so lately mind state's get better each day replay my relay race
when i was chasing the a fey at 18 8 years later his voice in beijing
no choice i chase cream so
this is what i eat sleep breath an feed my kids whatever i feel my family needs
i treat the mic like the block fought with my rocks an squeeze critics who expect me to under achieve
i just deal with the hate i receive i rolling back my sleeves  show other bree with bran wrapped to
his knees
an tell him suck my dick take a bow an leave with a sack full of amar cheese i found it hard to believe
who the bullet perceive to be g's an claim there running shit nigga i run me

who hid behind the freedom of speech
tryed to take the fifth amendment use it twist it and bend it
and ended up dying to fill out in the heros splinters 
the business way to end this i can feel the tremors tremendous
in remembrance of september 11
flash back to september 7th
when tupac was murdered in vegas
he said that he predicted his own death
let us never forget it or should we ever live to regret it
like the day john f kennedy was assasinated in broad day
by a craze lunatic with a gun
who just happened to work on the same block in a library book depository
where the president would go for a little friday stroll
shots fired from the grassy knoll
but they don't know or do they
whos they for them to say touch
where all vunerable and it's spooky
this is about as cookey as i've ever felt now
count down to nuclear meltdown
7 6 5 4 3 2 1
you can run you can do what you want to
but you know you aint gonna do nuttin
when its time its your time
you are the prime target
you have become public enemy number 1

and if his skills mastered
he's able to spill raps long after his killed that's a real mc
got you feeling me whether willing or unwillingly

then expect a longer life expectancy
i'd be a savage beast if i aingt have this outlet to salvage me inside
i'd be exploding soaked in self loathing an mourning
so i'm warning you don't coax me
it's silly i'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing
who only reacts when he gets pushed don't be fooled
the press blows up this whole thing it's stupid
they don't know 'cause they don't see that i'm wounded
all they did was ballooned it
i'm sick of talking 'bout these tattoos cartoon did
that's why i tuned it out i'm sick of duking
and they can suck my dick while i'm puking and you too you can
expect no sympathy from me i'm an mc
this is how i'm supposed to be
cold as a g my hearts frozen it don't even beat
so expect no apologies

nightmare it's horrible
right there's the coroner
waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya
you're a goner he's onto ya
out the corner of his cornea he just saw you run
all you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore you're done
all he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
while everybody is watching in the party applauding it
here i sit while i'm caught up in deep thought again
contemplating my next plot again
swallowing a klonopin while i'm nodding in and out on the ottoman
at the ramada inn holding on to the pill bottle then
lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom and make sure i got all of it
wake up naked at mcdonald's with
blood all over me dead bodies behind the counter shit
guess i must have just blacked out again
not again
it's 3 am in the morning
put my key in the door and
bodies laying all over the floor and
i don't remember how they got there
but i guess i must've killed em 
i said
sitting nude in my living room it's almost noon
i wonder what's on the tube maybe they'll show some boobs
surfing every channel until i find hannah montana
then i reach for the aloe and lanolin
bust all over the wall paneling dismantling every candle
on top of the fireplace mantle and
grab my flannel and my bandana then
kiss the naked mannequin man again
you can see him standing in my front window if you look in
i'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
causing illusions again
brain contusions again
cutting and bruising the skin
razors scissors and pins
jesus when does it end
phases that i go through
days that i'm so confused
days that i don't know who
gave these molecules to
me what am i gon' do
hey the prodigal son
the diabolical one
very methodical when i slaughter them
she puts the lotion in the bucket it puts the lotion on the skin or else it gets the hose again

last night was a blast
i can't quite remember when i had that
much fun of a half pint of a jack
my last vic and a half
a flashlight up kim kardashian's ass
i remember the first time i dismembered a family member
december i think it was i was having drinks with my cousin
i wrapped him in christmas lights pushed him into the stinking tub
cut him up into pieces and just when i went to drink his blood
i thought i oughta drink his bath water that oughta be fun
that's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
the sight of blood excites me that might be an artery son
your blood curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
it's 3 am and here i come so you should probably run
a secret passageway around here man there's got to be one

top of his lungs but aingt no stopping me from chopping him up up

we'll update en route
eta 10 minutes
as i fall deeper into a manic state
i'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait
blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
i seem to gravitate to the bottle of nyquil then i salivate
start off with the nyquil like i think i'll just have a taste
couple of sips of that then i gradually graduate
to a harder prescription drug called valium like ya that's great
i go to take just one and i end up like having eight
now i need something in my stomach cause i haven't ate
maybe i'll grab a plate of nachos and i'll have a steak
and you'd think with all i have at stake
look at my daughter's face mommy something is wrong with dad i think
he's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
and all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos
and he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat
sometimes i feel so alone
i just don't know
feels like i been down this road before
so lonely and cold
it's like something takes over me
soon as i go home and close the door
kinda feels like deja vu
i wanna get away from this place i do
but i can't and i won't say i tried but i know that's a lie cause i don't
and why i just don't know
maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
that's the devil in my ear i been sober a fucking year
and that fucker still talks to me he is all i can fucking hear
marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers
and maybe if i just drink half i'll be half buzzed for half of the time
who's that mastermind behind that little line
with that kind of rational man i got half a mind
to have another half of glass of wine sound asinine
ya i know
but i never had no problem with alcohol
ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch i'm about to fall
i missed the couch and down i go looking like a bouncy ball
shit must have knocked me out 'cause i aingt feel the ground at all
wow what the fuck happened last night where am i
man fuck am i hungover and god damn i got a head ache
shit half a vicodin why can't i
all systems ready for take off please stand by
so i take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ah
a couple weeks go by it aingt even like i'm getting high
now i need it just not to feel sick ya i'm getting by
wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die
oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use
there's new rules it's cool if it's helping you to get through
it's twelve noon aingt no harm in self inducing a snooze
what else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes
now here i am three months later full blown relapse
just get high until the kids get home from school homes relax
and since i'm convinced that i'm insomniac i need these pills to be able to sleep so i take 3 naps
just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
that's an ambien each nap how many valium three
and that will average out to about one good hours sleep
ok so now you see the reason how come he
has taken four years just to put out an album beat
see me and you we almost had the same outcome heath
cause that christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing
it was bologna was it the methadone ya think
or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
your vcr tape cases with you ambient cr great places to hide aingt it
so you can lie to hallie
i'm going beddy bye whitney baby good night alaina
go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
they said they found me on the bathroom floor damn
lately i've been hard to reach i've been too long on my own
everybody has a private world where they can be alone
are you calling me are you trying to get through
are you reaching out for me like i'm reaching out for you
i'm just so fucking depressed i just can't seem to get out this slump
if i could just get over this hump
but i need something to pull me out this dump
i took my bruises took my lumps
fell down and i got right back up
but i need that spark to get psyched back up
in order for me to pick the mic back up
i don't know how or why or when i ended up in this position i'm in
i'm starting to feel distant again
so i decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt to vent
but i just can't admit
or come to grips with the fact that i may be done with rap
i need a new outlet and i know some shit's so hard to swallow
but i just can't sit back and wallow
in my own sorrow
but i know one fact i'll be one tough act to follow
one tough act to follow
i'll be one tough act to follow
here today gone tomorrow
but you'd have to walk a thousand miles
in my shoes just to see
what it's like to be me
i'll be you let's trade shoes
just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine
go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each other's eyes
but don't let 'em say you aingt beautiful oh
they can all get fucked
just stay true to you
so don't let 'em say you aingt beautiful
oh they can all get fucked
just stay true to you yeah so
i think i'm starting to lose my sense of humor
everything is so tense and gloom
i almost feel like i gotta check the temperature in the room
just as soon as i walk in
it's like all eyes on me
so i try to avoid any eye contact
'cause if i do that then it opens the door for conversation
like i want that i'm not looking for extra attention
i just want to be just like you
blend in with the rest of the room
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
i don't need no fucking man servant
trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
laugh at every single joke i crack
and half of them aingt even funny like
ha marshall you're so funny man you should be a comedian god damn
unfortunately i am but i just hide behind the tears of a clown
so why don't you all sit down
listen to the tale i'm about to tell
hell we don't gotta trade our shoes
and you aingt gotta walk no thousand miles
but don't let 'em say you aingt beautiful
just stay true to you so
don't let 'em say you aingt beautiful
nobody asked for life to deal us
with these bullshit hands we're dealt
we gotta take these cards ourselves
and flip them don't expect no help
now i could have either just
sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
or take this situation in which i'm placed in
and get up and get my own
i was never the type of kid
to wait by the door and pack his bags
who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
for a dad to show up who never did
i just wanted to fit in
in every single place
every school i went
i dreamed of being that cool kid
even if it meant acting stupid
aunt edna always told me keep making that face it'll get stuck like that
meanwhile i'm just standing there
holding my tongue tryna talk like this
'til i stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
i learned my lesson then cause i wasn't tryna impress my friends no more
but i already told you my whole life story
not just based on my description
'cause where you see it from where you're sitting
it's probably 110% different
i guess we would have to walk a mile
in each other's shoes at least
what size you wear i wear tens
let's see if you can fit your feet
so are you calling me are you trying to get through oh
so oh oh
yeah to my babies stay strong
daddy will be home soon
and to the rest of the world god gave you them shoes
to fit you so put 'em on and wear 'em
be yourself man be proud of who you are
even if it sounds corny
don't ever let no one tell you you aingt beautiful
so

i won't have to rape you
so homie lay down down down lay down down down lay down down down lay down lay down
where's everybody going this always went over real big in gay a
ok wait i got another one
i just love condoms and lots of cum no oh shit
if i woulda rap about the crap that's out
that's the route you probably want me to take
cause you're just dying to know what i think
and my take on some other rappers
if i was to say something about paul wall you'd probably crap in your
pants cause i'm white and he's white so he's like
my competition i mean right
nope paul wall is dope
and so's bubba so blalalalapffttttt
b - b - b - b - b - but i don't compete with nobody
i just go hard do the rope - a - dope ali
shuffle and dance around my opponents do donuts
sometime's i just play possom like i'm asleep that's awesome
i'm like a sleeping giant and when i awake i'm like dre
i just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
sink my teeth in him and fill him full of poison
and make a noise like snake before i kill him
and let him know that i just don't feel him
and smack him with the backward e the eminem emblem
always thought if you was gonna murder somebody you should face em
tell em why look them dead in the eye then waste em
and the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
and swallow the shell of the hollow who dwell
and the shadows of all who are willing to sell
their souls for this rap game and it g - g - goes
123 123 123 that aingt the hook now follow me
there's nothing else for me to say my public adores me
everybody bores me they're just so corny
so at night before i sleep i look in the mirror
the mirror grows lips and it whispers come nearer

my darling you and me were meant to be together

my darling cause i possess your soul your mind your heart and your body

but dre all shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka

just hit me back and let me know what's up
fuck this mirror ahhhhhhh
i'm not in the mirror i'm inside you let me guide you
fuck you die you son of a bitch
put the gun down bye bye
ok i'm still alive so am i too
you can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
haha you sold your soul to me need i remind you
you remember that night you prayed to god
you'd give anything to get a record deal well dre signed you
this is what you wanted your whole life marshall right through
look at this house look at these cars i'm so nice wooo
oh but you didn't know fame has a price too
that you're just now seeing the downside to
lose your best friend from highschool your wife too
aingt even sure if your kids like you
come off tour can't even sleep at night without nyquill
become a valium addict start a rehab cycle
but together we can break the cycle
marshall what no one's gonna love you like i do
i said i don't ever want you to leave me
so this is it
this is what i wished for
just isn't how i envisioned it
famed to the point of imprisonment
i just thought the shit'd be different
but something changed
the minute that i got a whiff of it
i started to inhale it
smell it
started sniffing it
and it became my cocaine
i just couldn't quit
i just wanted a little bit
then it turned me  to a monster
i became a hypocrite
concert after concert
i was raking in the dough
rolling in green
had the game hemmed up
like a sewing machine
but i was losing my freedom
there was no where for me
to not go and be seen
and just go and be me
and there was no in - between
you either loved it or hate it
every cd critics gave it a 3 then 3
years later they'd go back and re - rate it
and call the slim shady lp the greatest
the marshall mathers was a classic
the eminem show was fantastic
but encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
i guess enough time just aingt passed yet
a couple more years that shit'll be ill - matic
and eight years later i'm still at it
divorce re - married
a felon
a father
sleeping pill addict
and this is real talk
i feel like the incredible hulk
my back has been broke and i can still walk
so be careful what you wish for
'cause you just might get it
and if you get it then you just might not know
what to do wit' it 'cause it might just
come back on you ten - fold
be careful what you wish for
i got a letter from a fan that said
he's been praying for me
every day and for some reason
it's been weighing on my mind heavy
'cause i don't read every
letter i get but something told me to go ahead and open it but
why would someone pray for you when they don't know you
you didn't pray for me when i was local
and as i lay these vocals
i think of all the shit i had to go through
just to get to where i'm at
i've already told you at least
a thousand times in these rhymes
i appreciate the prayer but i've already got
god on my side
and it's been one hell of a ride hasn't it
just watching it from an opposite standpoint
man boy's got to look
nuts
and that's the only word i can think of right now
on how
to describe the shit
this is like a vibe you get
go ahead and bob to it
just watch what you wish for 'cause i got the shit
it may not mean nothing to yall
but understand nothing was done for me
so i dont plan on stopping at all
i want this shit forever man ever man ever man
im shutting shit down at the mall
and telling every girl she the one for me
and i aint even planning to call
i want this shit forever man ever man ever man ever man
last name ever
first name greatest
like a sprained ankle boy i aint nothing to play with
started off local but thanks to all the haters
i know g4 pilots on a first name basis
in your city faded off the brown nino
she insists she got more class we know
swimming in the money come and find me nemo
if i was at the club you know i ball chemo
drop the mixtape that shit sounded like a album
who'da thought a country wide tour'd be the outcome
labels want my name beside the x like malcolm
everybody got a deal i did it without one
yeah nigga i'm about my business
killing all these rappers you would swear i had a hit list
everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
if you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness
bitches
i used to have hood dreams
big fame big chains
i stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
i went hard all fall like the ball teams
just so i can make it rain all spring
yall seen my story my glory
i had raped the game young
you can call it statutory
when a nigga blow up they gon build statures of me
old money benjamin button whaat nuttin
now superbad chicks giving me mclovin
you would think i ran the world like michelles husband
you would think these niggas would know me when they really doesnt
like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnt
youre such a fucking loser
he didnt even go to class bueller
trade the grammy plaques just to have my granny back
remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
chasing the stardom will turn you into a maniac
all the way in hollywood and i cant even act
they pull their cameras out and god damn they snap
i used to want this thing forever yall can have it back
ok hello it's da martian
space jam jordans
i want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden
fresher than the harvest
step up to the target
if i had one guess than i guess i'm just new orleans
and i will never stop like i'm running from the cops
hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
but what should i scream for this is my theme park
my minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
pistol on my side you dont wanna hear that thing talk
let the king talk check the price and pay attention
lil wayne thats what they got to say or mention
im like nevada in the middle of the summer
im resting in the lead i need a pillow and a cover
shhh my foots sleeping on the gas
no brake pads no such thing as last
there they go packing stadiums as shady spits his flow
nuts they go macadamian they go so ballistic whoa
he can make them look like bozos
he's wondering if he should spit this slow
fuck no go for broke
his cup just runneth over oh no
he aint had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
theyve been waiting patiently for pinocchio to poke his nose
back into the game and they know
rap will never be the same as before
bashing in the brains of these hoes
and establishing a name as he goes
the passion and the flame is ignited
you cant put it out once we light it
this shit is exactly what the fuck that i'm talking about when we riot
you dealin with a few true villains
whose stand inside of the booth truth spillin
and spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
now rewind it
payback muthafucka for the way that you doubted me hows it taste
when i slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
im hannibal lecter so just in case youre thinking of saving face
you aint gonna have no face to save by the time i'm through with this place
so drake
i want you to understand something
that when i come up in this bitch i want the fans jumping
i want them fists pumping in the air i don't look like a millionaire
but i feel like a million bucks ladies won't you fill your cups

 what's my name shady came to crush the game
instantly not even fair to them cause they pale in comparisons
so much they might as well wear a skin don't you wish you could just share his pen
cause this shit is getting embarrassing the fog is thick and the air is thin
cause he won't even let them try to breathe dadidadidadadi
he makes it look so easy girl you just hit the lottery
now this would be the part of the song
where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
try to restrain us you can't contain us
we still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
everywhere we go it seems we looking
for any excuse to just cut loose
so this would be the part of the song
this is when shit hits the fan like it just flat out don't stand
this is the only moment that matters your homie rolling with mathers
then chaos erupts em's in back dre's in the front
so do what we say and once it's over like a suance it hums

'round the back with binoculars not 'cause i want to peep
but because i'm hungry she smells like taco's i want to eat
visions of hot choclatey marshmallows also sweet
with sugar plums oh look here comes marshall he's on your street
he's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
now walk on 'em he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
like a thanksgiving turkey a holiday ham
cinnamon sprinkled on toast with strawberry marmalade jam
flavor my favorite graham crackers with jon benet rams
i guess a modern day jack the ripper is all that i am
my music box
cause when the lights are off i see the girl's asleep
but i can hear u my love you keep calling me
i want the world to know you mean the world to me
so when you call me to come i will answer
i hear my music box playing a song for me
so wont you whirl around and do a whirl for me
and want you be my private dancer
i almost look comatose who wants to be sobered gross
i foam like a doberman mouth open i overdose
put coke up my nostrils in both my holes and i plug my nose
my pupils quadruple in size eyes are so bugged i know
i put on my mother's make up get naked and run around
waving the gun around i think i'm down to a hundred pounds
there's thunder i wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
the devils upset with his wife they must be slugging it out
i must be bugging the fuck out but what the fuck about
voices are leading me up to the attic i love my house
they pull and they tug my blouse the sound of a music box
comes from inside a toy chest but what do i do it's locked
i pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts
i dig til i find it i wind it up and the tune just starts
it's playing a song so beautiful and the room is dark
the moon is full i smell a funeral guess i'll loom in the park
i'm fixated on asphyxating and breaking this little chick's
neck like a pixie stick
the sick satan worshipping bitches get horse - whippins
i'm in the back through the back door slip in
through the crack leaving the corpse dripping
the mortition of love sent from above
forced entry the more wenchy the more stingy i become
been doing this for more than a quarter century i'm just numb
am i dreaming is it real someone pinch me on the buns
the time has come to tie her up gotta roll me the ladder
i'd had enough of the chatter climb up to the window look at her
and climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her
with the bat a matter of fact that will splatter her
but before i do that i'll have a chat to flatter her
give her two compliments back - to - back like tabatha
i'm your secret admirer i'm back to ravish ya
so strong is your fight but you're no match for dracula
prolonging her plight as i go back to stabbing her
dismember her limbs simple as that cadaver her

i guess this is how you made me
ayo before i start this song man
i just want to thank everybody for being so patient
and bearing with me over these last couple of years
while i figure this shit out
is anybody out there
it feels like i'm talkin to myself
no one seems to know my struggle
and everything i come from
can anybody hear me
i guess i keep talkin to myself
it feels like i'm going insane
am i the one who's crazy
yeayah
woah wah
woah wah 
so why in the world do i feel so alone
nobody but me i'm on my own
is there anyone out there
who feels the way i feel
if there is let me hear just so i know i'm not the only one
i went away i guess to open up some lanes
but there was no one who even knew that i was going through growing pains
hatred was flowing through my veins
on the verge of going insane
i almost made a song dissin lil wayne
it's like i was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was getting
i felt horrible about myself
he was spittin and i wasn't
anyone who was buzzin back then coulda got it
almost went at kanye too
god it feels like i'm going psychotic
thank god that i didn't do it
i would've had my ass handed to me
and i knew it but proof wasn't here to see me through it
i'm in the booth poppin another pill tryna talk myself into it
are you stupid you gon' start dissin people for no reason
especially when you can't even write a decent punchline even
you're lying to yourself you're slowly dying you're denying
your health is declining with your self - esteem you're crying out for help
marshall you're no longer the man that's a bitter pill to swallow
all i know is i'm wallowing self - loathing and hollow
bottoms up on the pill bottle
maybe i'll hit my bottom tomorrow
my sorrow echoes in this hall though
but i must be talkin to the wall though
i don't see nobody else 
but all these other rappers suck is all that i know
i've turned into a hater i've put up a false bravado
but marshall is not a egomaniac that's not his motto
he's not a desperado he's desperate it's starting to bottle inside 'em
one foot on the brake one on the throttle
fallin asleep with writers block in the parking lot of mcdonald's
but instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something about it
admit you got a problem you brain is clouded you pouted long enough
it isn't them it's you you fuckin baby
quit worrying about what they do and do shady
i'm fucking going crazy
so i pick myself off the ground and fuckin swam 'fore i drowned

of what the fuck i can do when i'm on the mic
or you're the kind of girl that i can take a liking to
psych i'm spiking you like a football

shut the fuck up while my shit's playing
i'ma shit stain on the underwear of life
what's the saying where there's thunder there's lightning
and they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
then how the fuck have i been hit six times
in three different locations
on four separate occasions
and you can bet your stinking ass
that i've come to smash everything in my path
fork was in the road took the psychopath
poison ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash
so hit the dance floor cutie while i do my duty on this microphone
shake your booty shawty i'm the shit
why you think proof used to call me doody
yeah oh get up i said get up let's go
better watch out now
here we come 
and we aingt stopping until

so give us room to do our thing
cause we aingt come to hurt no one 
so everybody come on get up on the floor
right now and grab someone 
now first of all i'm the boss
i just wanna get that across
man even my dentist hates when i floss
pull up to the club in a pinto likes it's a porsche
garbage bag for one of the windows
spray - painted doors with the flames on 'em
michigan plates and my name's on 'em
baby shady's here come on get him
if you dames want 'em
but he aingt stupid so quit trying to run them games on him
he's immune to cupid why you trying to put your claims on him
cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
now climb in back try not to kick over the gas can
there's a half a gallon in it that could be our last chance
we have of just getting home now could i get that lap dance
she's got a tattoo of me right above her ass man
in the streets of warren michigan we call 'em tramp stamps
that means she belongs to me time to put the damn clamps
down and show this hussy who's the man
now get in dance
now you can do this on your own
but everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
so get on the floor and grab somebody
aingt nothing but a white trash party
so let's have us a little bash
and if anyone asks
it aingt no one but us trash
you dunno you better ask somebody
cause we're having a white trash party
pull a fifth of bacardi from outta my underwear
and walk around the party without a care
like a body without a head
looking like a zombie from night of the living dead
and tomorrow i probably still be too high to get outta bed
til i feel like i been hit wit the sharp part'a the hammer
mixing hennessey and fanta with pepto and mylanta
i shoot the gift like i'm hollering die santa
missed the tree and hit rudolph and two innocent bystanders
so quit trying ta play the wall like you balling
get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stalling
they call me the stephon marbury of rap darling
cause as soon as they throw on some r - kelly i start balling
making it rain for the ladies in the mini's
but i'm not throwing ones fives tens or even twenties
i'm throwing quarters nickels dimes pennies up at skinnies
man i do this for them bunnies up at denny's
from the north east and west but when
it comes to them trailers in them south parks
muffle it cause homie that hood's tighter than kenny's
so ladies if your belly button's not an innie then i'm outie
now hop in my minivan let's get rowdy
c'mon
if there aingt no one but us trash
now whether you're black white or purple
if you're misunderstood
but you don't give a fuck
you aingt doing shit that you should
long as you know you're up to evil
and you're no damn good
get on the floor man and rep your 'hood
now honey don't let them pricks trip
we should make a quick dip
and go do some donuts in the hospital parking lot
cause girl i got a sick wip
kick the back window outta my gremlin
put two milk crates in the trunk
rip out the stick shift and
make a five seater
i'll be damned if i feed a chick
it aingt like me to split a piece 'a dry pita
i'll be the s - l to the i - m to the s - h - a - d - y
and i don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
i'll rip a tree out the ground
and flip it upside down
'fore i turn over a new leaf clown
i'll tell ya now
i'm so raw i still need to un - thaw
you feel me yall
i shut the club down like drake in the mall
but baby a body like that's against the law
you the baddest little chain with the blades i ever saw
cold slaw containers empty straw wrappers and all
you got more junk in your trunk than i do in my car
now get up
i'm going through changes
lately i really feel like i'm rolling for delf like philly
feel like i'm losing control of myself i sincerely
apologize if all that i sound like is i'm complaining
but life keeps on complicating and i'm debating
on leaving this world this evening even my girls
can see i'm grieving i try and hide it
but i can't why do i act like i'm all high and mighty
when inside i'm dying i am finally realizing i need help
can't do it myself too weak two weeks i've been having ups and downs
going through peaks and valleys dilly dallying
round with the idea of ending the shit right here
i'm hating my reflection i walk around the house trying to fight mirrors
i can't stand what i look like yeah i look fat but what do i care
i give a fuck only thing i fear is hailie
i'm afraid if i close my eyes and i might see her
shit
i lock myself in the bedroom bathroom napping at noon
yeah dad's in a bad mood he's always snapping at you
marshall what happened that you can't stop with these pills
and you falling off with yer skills and your own fans are laughing at you
it become a problem you're too pussy to tackle get up
be a man stand a real man would've had this shit handled
 know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
they say proof just flipped out homie just whipped out and bust
nah it aingt like doody to do that
he wouldn't fucking shoot at nobody he'd fight first
but dwelling on it only makes the night worse
now i'm popping vic's perks and methadone pills
yeah em tight verse you killed it
fucking drug dealers hang around me like yes men
and they gon' do whatever i says when i says it
it's in their best interest to protect their investment
and i just lost my fucking best friend so fuck it i guess then
my friends can't understand this new me
that's understandable man but think how bananas you'd be
you'd be an animal too if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
and everybody's looking at you what you want me to do
i'm starting to live like a recluse and the truth is
fame's starting to give me an excuse to be at a all time low
i sit alone in my home theater watching the same damn dvd
of the first tour the last tour he was still alive
and it hurts so i fast forward sleeping pills will make me feel alright
and if i'm still awake in the middle of the night
i'll just take a couple more yeah you're motherfucking right
i aingt slowing down for no one i am almost homeward bound
almost in a coma yeah homie come on dole 'em out
daddy don't you die on me daddy better hold your ground
fuck don't i know the sound of that voice
yeah baby hold me down
wake up in the hospital full of tubes but somehow i'm pulling through
swear when i come back i'ma be bulletproof
i'ma do it just for proof i think i should state a few
facts 'cause i may not get a chance again to say the truth
shit it just hit me that what if i would not have made it through
i think about the things i would have never got to say to you
i'd never get to make it right so here's what i came to do
hailie this one is for you whitney and alaina too
i still love your mother that'll never change
think about her every day we just could never get it together
hey wish there was a better way for me to say it
but i swear on everything i'd do anything for her on any day
there are just too many things to explain when it rains
guess it pours yes it does wish there wasn't any pain
but i can't pretend there aingt i aingt placing any blame
i aingt pointing fingers heaven knows i've never been a saint
i know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
and just today i looked at your picture almost if to say
i miss you subconsciously wish it didn't end this way
but i just had to get away don't know why
i don't know what else to say i guess i'm
i'm not afraid 
to take a stand 
everybody 
come take my hand 
we'll walk this road together through the storm
whatever weather cold or warm
just letting you know that you're not alone
holler if you feel like you've been down the same road 
yeah it's been a ride
i guess i had to go to that place to get to this one
now some of you might still be in that place
if you're trying to get out just follow me
i'll get you there
you can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before i lay 'em
but you won't take the sting out these words before i say 'em
cause aingt no way i'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem
when i say i'ma do something i do it
i don't give a damn what you think
i'm doing this for me so fuck the world
feed it beans it's gassed up if it thinks it's stopping me
i'ma be what i set out to be without a doubt undoubtedly
and all those who look down on me i'm tearing down your balcony
no ifs ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
from infinite down to the last relapse album
he's still shitting whether he's on salary paid hourly
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
whichever comes first for better or worse
he's married to the game like a fuck you for christmas
his gift is a curse forget the earth he's got the urge
to pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
okay quit playing with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
i shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
you said you was king you lied through your teeth for that
fuck your fillings instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
and to the fans i'll never let you down again i'm back
i promise to never go back on that promise in fact
let's be honest that last relapse cd was ehhh
perhaps i ran them accents into the ground
relax i aingt going back to that now
all i'm trying to say is get back click - clack blow
cause i aingt playing around
it's a game called circle and i don't know how i'm way too up to back down
but i think i'm still trying to figure this crap out
thought i had it mapped out but i guess i didn't this fucking black cloud
still follows me around but it's time to exorcise these demons
these motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now
and i just can't keep living this way
so starting today i'm breaking out of this cage
i'm standing up i'ma face my demons
i'm manning up i'ma hold my ground
i've had enough now i'm so fed up
time to put my life back together right now 
it was my decision to get clean i did it for me
admittedly i probably did it subliminally
for you so i could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
and don't even realize what you did 'cause believe me you
i been through the ringer but they could do little to the middle finger
i think i got a tear in my eye i feel like the king of
my world haters can make like bees with no stingers
and drop dead no more beef lingers
no more drama from now on i promise
to focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
so i solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
and raise it you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
cause the way i feel i'm strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
cause i'm raising the bar
i'd shoot for the moon but i'm too busy gazing at stars
i feel amazing and i'm
i don't know man
just feels like we're a lot different kinda feels like we're on a whole different page right now
it feels strange but uh i guess it's kinda like it's kinda like
i feel like i'm morphing into something that's so incredible that i'm dwarfing all competitors
better get your girlfriend in check it's psychological warfare endorphin side affect
his self esteem shatters his dialect comes blasting out your deck she loves me
such passion you'd expect this sort of reaction from her yet you strong arm
you're fucking corny you try to turn your charm on 'cause you just think your bishop the don juan
but if you think that you're fucking with me homie you're on one
i'm cocking my head back like ed lover c'mon son she's on my johnson
she brings my name up constant your boys are like she's fucking with dude she wants him
oh boy you better get a clue she's on my dick 'cause i spit better than you what you expect her to do
how you expect her to act in the sack when she's closing her eyes fantasizing of digging her nails in my back to this track
seduction seduce aingt nobody who's as good at what i do
'cause one minute she loves you the next she don't
she's been stolen from you
she sitting there getting liquored up at the bar
she says it's quicker to count the things that aingt wrong with you than to count the things that are
there's a seven disc cd changer in her car and i'm in every single slot and you're not aww
i'm the logo on the dallas cowboy helmet
the star and i'm not about to sit back and just keep rhyming one syllable aww
switch it up and watch them haters not give it up 'cause ya just not good enough
well i'm not giving up til i get my respect and i won't stop til i get enough
'cause i'm not living up to my own expectations aww
that hater alarm is sounding off that obama took the bomb from my name aww
so quit crying that i took your dame homie she's my dame aww
you sadly mistaking if you thinking that i'm not on my game boy
and things just aingt been the same since the day that i came forth

but you got a hard on for me what you hollering my name for

rummage through the shit and try to salvage something to see if you can save any of it
punk but none of it's fucking with me prick you really feeling that bullshit
you think you killing them syllables quit playing these beats aingt nothing to fool with
they call me fire marshall i shut the shit down
your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
i am also the opposite of what you are like you are microcosm of what the fuck i am on the mic
i am awesome and you are just aww struck she's love stricken
she's got her jaw stuck from sucking my dick aww fuck
'cause one minute she wants you the next she don't she's been stolen from you
so don't you seduce at what i do 'cause one minute she wants you the next she don't
we touch i feel a rush
we clutch it isn't much
but it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
it's lust it's torturous
you must be a sorceress 'cause you just
did the impossible
gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous
if you fuck me over
'cause if i get burnt i'ma show you what it's like to hurt
'cause i've been treated like dirt before you
and love is evol
spell it backwards i'll show you
nobody knows me i'm cold
walk down this road all alone
it's no one's fault but my own
it's the path i've chosen to go
frozen as snow i show no emotion whatsoever so
don't ask me why i have no love for these motherfucking ho's
bloodsucking succubuses what the fuck is up with this
i've tried in this department but i aingt had no luck with this
it sucks but it's exactly what i thought it would be
like trying to start over
i got a hole in my heart but some kind of emotional roller coaster
something i won't go on 'til you toy with my emotions so it's over
it's like an explosion every time i hold you i wasn't joking when i told you
you take my breath away
you're a supernova and i'm a
i'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
and i'm aiming right at you
right at you
two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in june
i'll do whatever it takes
when i'm with you i get the shakes
my body aches when i aingt
with you i have zero strength
there's no limit on how far i would go
no boundaries no lengths
why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same
you want them when they don't want you
soon as they do feelings change
it's not a contest and i aingt on no conquest for no mate
i wasn't looking when i stumbled onto you must've been fate
but so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
let's cut to the chase
'fore a door shuts in your face
promise me if i cave in and break and leave myself open
that i won't be making a mistake
so after a year and six months it's no longer me that you want
but i love you so much it hurts
never mistreated you once
i poured my heart out to you
let down my guard swear to god
i'll blow my brains in your lap
lay here and die in your arms
drop to my knees and i'm pleading
i'm trying to stop you from leaving
you won't even listen so fuck it
i'm trying to stop you from breathing
i put both hands on your throat
i sit on top of you squeezing
'til i snap your neck like a popsicle stick
aingt no possible reason i could think of to let you walk up out this house
and let you live
tears stream down both of my cheeks
then i let you go and just give
and before i put that gun to my temple
i told you this
and i would have did anything for you
to show you how much i adored you
but it's over now
it's too late to save our love
just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause i'm a
and i'm so lost without you
without you
you know technically i'm not even really supposed to be here right now

but i've already wasted over half of my life i would've laid
down and died for you i no longer cry for you
no more pain bitch you
took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
into the dirt i can no longer stand it

and what i mean is that i will no longer let you control me
so you better hear me out this much you owe me
i gave up my life for you totally devoted to you while i've stayed
faithful all the way this is how i fucking get repaid
look at how i dress fucking baggy sweats go to work a mess
always in a rush to get back to you i aingt heard you yet
not even once say you appreciate me i deserve respect
i've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
and i know that if i end this i'll no longer have nothing left
but you keep treating me like a staircase it's time to fucking step
and i wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath

i told you you'd be sorry if i fucking left
i'd laugh while you wept
hows it feel now yeah funny aingt it you neglected me
did me a favor although my spirit free you've set
but a special place for you in my heart i have kept
it's unfortunate but it's
too late for the other side 
i feel like when i bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
cause that aingt good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
til i snap
don't think i'm loyal
all i do is rap

i have been changing faces
you can not fill these shoes
there is too much to lose
wake up behind these trenches
you run around defenseless
i just want to be famous
but be careful what you wish for
i stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
they call me slim roethlisberger
i go berserker than a fed - up post - office worker
a murker with a mossberg
i'm pissed off get murdered
like someone took a ketchup squirter
squirted a frankfurter
for a gangster you sure did shit your pants
when you saw that chainsaw get to waving
like a terrible towel
how thangs turn out
when his fangs come out
get your brains blown out
that's what i call blowing your mind
when i cum back
like nut on your spine
i'm the thumb tack
that you slept on son
now here i come screaming a tac like i just stepped on one
low on the totem till he showed 'em
defiance giant scrotum
he don't owe 'dem bitches shit
his britches he out growed 'em
he's so out cold he's knocked out at the south pole
and nobody fucks with him
rigor mortis and post mortem
he's dying of boredom
take your best rhymes record 'em
to try to thwart him
he'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
shit stained drawers
you gon' fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
while he dips 'em in pf chang's sauce
games off homie hang it up like some crank calls
you think i'm backing down
you must be out of your dang skulls
i'm almost famous
i'm back for revenge
i lost a battle that aingt happening again
i'm at your throat like strep
i step strapped with a pen
metaphors wrote on my hand
some are just stored in my memory
some are wrote on a napkin
i do what i have to to win
pulling out all stops any who touch a mic prior's
not even austin powers how the fuck are they mike meyers
and tell that psycho to pass the torch
to the whacko 'fore i take a shit in his jack - o - lantern
and smash it on his porch
now get off my dick
dick's too short of a word for my dick
get off my antidisestablishmentarianism you prick
don't call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
i just blew up the challenger matta' fact i need a lawyer
i just laced my gloves wit' enough plaster
to make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like vern troyer
ya'll are eminem backwards your meni me's
see he's in a whole 'nother weight class
he slugs you're bb's you're bean bag bullets
you're full of it; you were dissing his cd's
laughed at infinite now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
no peace treaties he's turned into a beast
his new slim shady ep's got the attention of the mighty d r e
he's almost famous
now there he goes in dre's studio cupping his balls
screaming the wood off the panelling
cussing the paint off the walls
spewing his hate to these haters showing no love for these broads
he aingt given 'em shit he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
he'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
when it scars till abraham lincoln is screaming out awww
his metaphors and similes aingt similar to them not at all
if they don't like it they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
they can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by
like david carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
and eat shit while they at it
he's fucking had it he's mad at the whole world
so go to hell and build a snowman girl
the bullies become bullied if pussies get pushed
then they better pull me take me back to 9th grade to school me
'cause i aingt looking back only forward this whole spot blow it
who could have known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it
and while i'm being poetic let me get historic and raise the bar
higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
so bare witness to some biblical shit
there's a cold wind blowing
this world aingt gonna know what hit it
he did it he made it he's finally famous
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i can't tell you what it really is
i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe but i still fight while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right it's like i'm in flight
high off her love drunk from her hate
it's like i'm huffing paint and i love her the more i suffer i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown she resuscitates me
she fucking hates me and i love it
wait where you going
i'm leaving you
no you aingt come back
we're running right back
here we go again
it's so insane cause when it's going good it's going great
i'm superman with the wind at his back she's lois lane
but when it's bad it's awful i feel so ashamed i snapped
who's that dude
i don't even know his name
i laid hands on her i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength
you ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
you meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feeling
yeah them chills you used to get 'em
now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
you swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em
now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
you push pull each other's hair scratch claw bit 'em
throw 'em down pin 'em
so lost in the moments when you're in them
it's the rage that took over
it controls you both
so they say you're best to go your separate ways
guess that they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday
yesterday is over it's a different day
sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
next time you show restraint
you don't get another chance
life is no nintendo game
but you lied again
now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane
now i know we said things did things that we didn't mean
and we fall back into the same patterns same routine
but your temper's just as bad as mine is
you're the same as me
when it comes to love you're just as blinded
baby please come back
it wasn't you baby it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk
told you this is my fault
look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed i'll aim my fist at the drywall
next time there won't be no next time
i apologize even though i know its lies
i'm tired of the games i just want her back
i know i'm a liar
if she ever tries to fucking leave again
im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
i'm just gonna
the days are cold living without you 
the nights are long i'm growing older
i miss the days of old thinking about you 
you may be gone but you're never over
if proof could see me now i know he'd be proud
somewhere in me deep down there's something in me he found
that made him believe in me now no one can beat me now

that means suicide homie you'll never throw me
off of this course blow me
bitch i do this all for the sport only
but i want it all i'm not just talking awards homie
and the balls in my court and it's lonely
on top of the world when you're the only
one with the balls in your shorts
to leave their jaws on the floors with no re
morse remember that when they get to dogging you boy homie
so ya all can just get to blogging about bologna i'm not gonna stop the saga continues

just blaze and me we are knocking on doors and no we
aingt pumpkins on halloween but we'll show up on your porch so be
careful what you say there aingt no punks over here so follow me
through the fog like i'm s - n double o - p

and it don't stop oh

and i miss you oh

so sick it'll blow up the mic it'll put the dyna in mite
yeah it'll make the dopest mc wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
tap dancing all over the beat it'll jump off the page and spit itself
guess that the best thing i could do right now doody for you is to rap
so i'm gonna fuck 'til i die yeah i'm a do it to death
and instead of mourning your death i'd rather celebrate your life
elevate to new heights step on the gas and accelerate i'm a need 2 mics
cause the way that i'm feeling tonight everything i can just do right
there's nothing that i can do wrong i'm too strong and i'm just too hyped
just finish the rhyme and bust it excuse this corny metaphor
but they'll never ketchup to all this energy that i've mustard
so god just help me out while i fight through this grieving process
trying to process this loss is making me nauseous
but this depression aingt taking me hostage
i've been patiently watching this game pacing these hallways
you had faith in me always
proof you knew i'd come out of this slump rise from these ashes
come right back on they asses and go mike tyson on these bastards
and i'm a show em blow em out the water slaughter em homes
i'm a own so many belts the only place they can hit me is below em
homie i know i'm never gonna be the same without you
i never would've came in this game i'm going insane without you
matter of fact it was just the other night had another dream about you
you told me to get up i got up i spread my wings and i flew
you gave me a reason to fight i was on my way to see you

where's jumpoff joe beezy
obie the person that came up introverted
cause of nervousness that was solely the only verdict
it was worth it cause he changed became so observant
serving such of a purpose
if you knew him earlier in his days its like a different version
so much hurting and pain gave him game for certain
that's why there's curtains in this murder if you getting worked up
i'm so assertive on these motherfuckers acting tougher
i had enough of isolating myself in a room
writing poems and songs doing the same in school
now look what he became a fool
cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
living hard but still juliard a god walks in but aingt spend a day in the pew
regardless of this i draw visual pictures when a nigga vents
so welcome to the art department
i stimulate the brain mimic emulate the sane
cinic keep em' thinking its a fucking gimmick when it aingt
clinically insane brain is on venus suck uranus
label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say
he may seem as though he's plain normal
if you ever meet him greet him with a shake see
he aingt as mean as what they say
see the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
so he's vague so they mistake him for just being crazed
you part ways your impression of him changed
you don't think he's strange you turn around and tell him peace and thanks
then you catch him flipping you off with his pants down
hands around his scrotum tucking his fucking penis between his legs
its all psychologic why am i so maniacal
am i psycho or some kind of psychotic stick
or am i truly psychotic or my molecules just diabolical
cause biologically i defy logic bye golly hall me off  on a trolly probably wanna cracker i'm back on the wacky tobacco
i'm a step away from crack obie smack the shit outta me

cation and get the patient some darvocet to chew cuz

somebody tell these girls please release my undies
nobody really understands my language
i find it complicated just to hold a conversation
but still i got a whole lot of patience
sitting back watching earth from my space station
oh my gosh i put natasha bendingfield in a washer
watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
its like i got ya hypnotising like i gotcha

i get sick thoughts  -  sick sick thoughts
the things you could do with your lipstick gloss
put it on my dick 'til the tip looks orange
bitch keep going  -  bitch keep going
banana
banana 
i'm a goat
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and i consider myself one of those
so thank you very much here it goes
this is the part i was worried about
everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
and i'm in some dusty garage inhaling them carbon monoxide fumes
and everyone's telling me what i should do
and how i should come out and what to rap about
and i know i got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that i gotta get out
and i'm not sure how this is gonna come off
they're probably gonna think that i'm coming off as cocky 
like i just started giving a fuck what you really think about me
see the thing about me
is you don't really know a thing about me
everyone's making a stink about me
like there's some kind of a aura of that of the king around me
surround me with nothing but gangsters killers and bangers
and the most dangerous criminals
and i feel like i'm more comfortable around them than i do my own motherfucking neighbors
but see my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when i leave
but why does it seem like i'm not even put up in the same category as other emcees
so when weezy says that he's better than jay - z
please be that just subliminally
means he thinks jigga's the best and that he's
the only one up in that league see
and it's easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is
knowing god damn well that i'm one of the best motherfucking rappers who ever lived period
and i don't mean to gloat
but i know what i know and i know what you think
and these magazines'll never put it in ink
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat
maybe they figure that i'm on my way out the game
so they gotta go try to find em a new eminem
or a new shady if they think it's gonna happen
man i thought i was crazy
or maybe i could be taking it wrong and they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
see you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringing up that paul wall's white
cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone see he's just aight
and bubba sparxxx he just won't write
because he's so caught up in that snow white
that timbaland can't even get him in the studio
he's so gone off that coke right
and it's so sad cause he's dope right
america's next great white hope right
so now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny ass white rapper show right
and which i'm still having mixed feelings about
they said it'd be real i'm just spilling it out
there's something about a white boy talking black and running around with a damn grill in his mouth
and i love when the say that tiger woods shit
isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white and the best golfer's black
and i'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack offa' that
but these are the people who never had heard of an eminem until 8 mile had came out
but i had already hit middle america
parents had all got to liking me now
when suddenly i wasn't such a bad guy
all of the hatred for me must've died
thought i committed career suicide so i had to turn back into the bad guy
so faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
and anatomy god made raggedy ann and andy
not raggedy andy and andy and andy
and angelina jolie is just another ho
and brad is a sucka' because once i fuck her
she wants to go to somalia to adopt another baby
you know what i say no
you better save some of them kids from madonna
she needs all the publicity she can get
you want a shady well you got it man
i aingt apologizing for shit
man i'm taking my ball and going home man
shit is too easy
nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause
so don't worry i'm out the motherfucking game
and y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfucking best
but y'all know that
and like i said i'm one of the motherfucking best
before you get your panties in a motherfucking bunch
but before i go i'd like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasn't there from the start
and thank you very much to everybody who was
and y'all aingt gotta say it just think it
cause i know that you know that i know that you know that i know that you know
i'm out y'all
it's been real peace
i'm a little nutty and i know it
but if you go back and
take a look at my history
you will see that i'm
not the only one who's off his rocker
there were many before me 
i was always labelled
the black sheep of the family what a bad seed i
grow to be but if you take a look
at us now you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree
 alright look
i'ma tell you the story
from my side maybe you'll understand check it out 
you done witnessed
unexplainable shit
too insane to explain
people run from what
the just don't get
maybe shady shoulda
just hit 'em with a little bit
did i spit too soon
should i of spoon fed 'em it
but i was just so eager
to prove i was even worth
being in the same
league or the room with of the people
of whom i was in every now and then i
look up like i was seeking approval
was it because of the
pigment of my skin
or was it a figment of
my imagination
maybe it bothered me
more than it did them
maybe it wasn't a big
deal back then
but to me it was see
what it was was
i had developed the
complex from being judged
proof spit his verse
now i'm next let's see who
i'm in the booth
staring back to see who's mugs
i get a reaction from
usually the first thumb was from
proof
and the rest of the
group backed him up
and no one lied to
each other cause none of us had deals
it was real we just
wanted tickets for that meal
sometimes i feel like
it's just me
i'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree
i said 
ever since my mother
was pregnant
with her second egg
cause she said
that i had a baby sister
who fell out of the window
i was too young to remember
kansas city projects
i was like 5 6 and how come
i remember malcolm
isaac and boogie
if it was the projects in missouri
cause those're my best
friends until isaac
took my tricycle and
my uncle todd went to try to go get it back
and ended up getting
jumped and cut in the gut with a
switch and 70 - some stitches
which is still to this day
why my mother still
tries to show me some old fake picture
of a fictitious little
sister who never existed and this is why part of
my life's so twisted
but i can never be as
sick as that bitch is
and by the way that
picture's one of my relatives
you probably have to
peel back layers upon layers of
pain to see why everything
i say is so insane
what's different about my brain that separates me
from other players in this game on the surface it may
seem like a scheme or some sort of scam
for me to get some damn sympathy
but that's the last thing
i need is for people
to walk around feeling
sorry for me 
and i'm not a g never
claimed to be
i gave my vest to
cashis
he'll need it more than me
but we'll see cause we aingt looking for beef
but if it comes our
way what do we turn the other
cheek come on
but take a look at my family
thanks it's been real
i love you but i just can't deal
with the stress this game is giving me
but before i go
you know
i can't close the show
without no closure
so before i leave
i just want to take the time out
to basically say
rest in peace
to deshaun holton
that's my heart man
for giving me the oppurtunity
just to even listen to me
to get me to this point
i'd like to thank jimmy iovine
interscope aftermath 
everybody in the whole shady staff
everybody whose basically supported me from day one

especially when the worlds silly putty in ya hands its playdough
i aint got to play though they say i died in a fatal
car crash shows what they know

the white trash star
i fuckin rv up like brett favre

i can carry rap til my back hurts
set it down go right back to the chiropractors
get my back right
now im right back on you bastards
i was chasin the dragon i dont know what happened
it was like the feelin i had when i first started rappin
i just couldnt seem to get back and recapture that magic
so i went back to the lab thats where ive been at when
i took a hiatus haters now im back to cause trouble
got the fucking shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles
im the *bang* you aint fuckin sick
the hospital wont even give you cough drops for course cocksucker
you think your hot you aint even luke warm
my pubes hotter than you
your soft i use fire to cool me off
i told em ill grow up one day and show em id be able to choke clouds
pick up lightenin bolts and throw em
take the world by storm with these words i form
georgie porgie kissed the girls make the girls cry for em
make em swarm make em fight over the shirts ive worn
sworn over my sweat towels its mind blowin
yes im livin the dream homie cant nothin compare

its like these people are steps now all they do is stare
these haters is so pussy theyre afraid to be scared
this is pay back like i owe em back pay
they spat in my face now im back to do them the same exact way
and leave this rap game with a bad taste
and slap it back out before i step back out of this crap thanks
slap me now im slapping em back hey fuck it well slap back
but yeh okay now well talk cause im smack ay
and i aint looking back infact they can stare at my ass crack
hows that for hindsight what the track say
its like i'm in this dirt digging up old hurt
tried everything to get my mind off you it wont work
all it takes is one song on the radio youre right back on it
reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
and left me so burnt spent a lot of time trying to soul search
maybe i needed to grow up a little first
well looks like i hit a growth spurt
but i am coming for closure
dont suppose an explanation im owed for
the way that you turned your back on me
just when i may have needed you most
oh you thought it was over
you could just close the chapter
and go about your life like it was nothing
you ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine
well ive never recovered but tonight i betcha that whatcha
'bout to go throughs tougher than anything i ever have suffered
cant think of a better way to define poetic justice
can i hold grudges mind saying: let it go fuck this
heart's saying: i will once i bury this bitch alive
hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset
i flee the scene like it was my last ride
you see right through
oh you had me pegged the first time
you can see the truth
but it's easier to justify
what's bad is good
and i hate to be the bad guy
i just hate to be the bad guy
and to think i used to think you was the shit bitch
to think it was you at one time i worshipped shit
think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch
finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew  knit wit
thought some time had past and i'd forget it forget it
you left our family in shambles
you expect me to just get over him pretend he never existed
may be gone but he's not forgotten
and don't think cause he's been out the picture so long
that i've stopped the plotting and still aingt coming to get ya
you're wrong and that shit was rotten
and the way you played him same shit you did to me cold
have you any idea the shit that i've gone through
feelings i harbor all this pent - up resentment i hold on to
not once you call to ask me how i'm doing
letters you don't respond to 'em
fuck it i'm coming to see you
and gee who better to talk to than you
the cause of my problems
my life is garbage and i'm 'bout to take it out on you
poof then i'm gone voosh
and
i've been driving around your side of this town
like 9 fricking hours and 45 minutes now
finally i found your new address park in your drive
feel like i been waiting on this moment all of my life
and it's now arrived and my mouth is fulla' saliva
my knife is out and i'm ducking on the side of your house
see it's sad it came to this point
such a disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya
but i aingt here for ya empathy i don't need your apology
or your friendship or sympathy it's revenge that i seek
so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
like i reach my full potential - i peeked
continue to peep still bent low
keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
man door handles unlocked shouldn't be that easy to do this
you don't plan for intruders beforehand
surprised to see me cat got your tongue
gag chloroform rag dag almost hack - up a lung
like you picked an axe up and swung
stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk
by one of your fans irony's spectacular huh
now who's a faggot you punk
and here's your bronco hat you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
it's just me you and the music now slim
i hope you hear it we're in a car right now
wait here comes my favorite lyric
and hey here's a sequel to my mathers lp
just to try to get people to buy
well how's this for publicity stunt this should be fun
last album now cause after this you'll be officially done
eminem killed by m and m
matthew mitchell bitch i even have your initials
i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
since you're in love with your city so much
i figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
two more exits time is quite near
i hope we don't get stopped no license i fear
that sirens i hear guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
new plan stan
slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car
well gotta go almost at the bridge haha big bro it's for you
slim this is for him and frank ocean hope you can swim good
now say you hate homos again
i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
i'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
i'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
nope it's hopeless i'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
when they say all of this is approaching its end
but you refuse to believe that it's over here we go all over again
back's to the wall im stacking up all them odds toilet's clogged
yeah cause im talking a lotta shit but im backing it all up
but in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers
after the track is demolished
i am your lack of a conscience
im the ringing in your ears
im the polyps on the back of your tonsils
eating your vocal chords after your concerts
im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged
grab for some water but im that pill thats too jagged to swallow
im the bullies you hate that you became
with every faggot you slaughtered
coming back on you every woman you insult batter
but the double - standards you have when it comes to your daughters
i represent everything you take for granted
cause marshall mathers the rappers personas half a facade and
matthew and stan just symbolic of you not knowing what you had 'til its gone
cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them
i'm the hindsight to say i told you so
foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
i'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
if you dont stop after they call you
biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits
when its time to walk away
im every guilt trip the baggage you have
but as you gather up all your possessions
if there's anything you have left to say
unless it makes an impact then don't bother
so before you rest your case
better make sure you're packing a wallop
so one last time im back
before it fades into black and its all over
behold the final chapter in the saga
trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
twice the magic that started it all
tragic portrait of an artist tortured
trapped in his own drawings
tap into thoughts
blacker and darker than anything imaginable
here goes a wild stab in the dark
as we pick up where the last mathers left off
hurry the fuck up
thank you
go go go 
mothafucker bail on me fuck you
aw you gotta be fucking kidding me
are you fucking kidding me
get off
the parking lot
shit ah
 marshall
 i don't have one
my mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
and had me on the back of a motorcycle
then crashed in the side of locomotive with rap i'm loco
it's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
about to explode all over the canvas
back with the yoda of rap in a spasm
a jedi in training colossal brain and thoughts of entertaining
but docile and impossible to explain and i'm also vain and
probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting
puke skywalker but sound like chewbacca when i talk
full of such blind rage i need a seeing eye dog
can't even find the page i was writing this rhyme on 
its on a rampage couldn't see what i wrote i write small
 ever since i drove a 79 lincoln with white walls
had a fire in my heart and a dire desire to aspire to die hard
so as long as i'm on the clock punching this time card
hip hop aingt dying on my watch
but sometimes when im sleeping she comes to me in my dreams
is she taken is she mine dont got i dont care dont have two shits to give
let me take you by the hand to promise land and threaten everyone
'cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing
nah  marshall
 i dont know him but i wonder
no
if he had he wouldnt have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
i wouldnt be so mad my attitude wouldnt be so bad yeah dad
i'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens
when the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands and
makes you want to get up and start dancing
even if it is charles manson who just happens to be rapping
blue lights flashing laughing all the way to the bank
lamping in my k - mart mansion im in the style department
with a pile in my cart ripping the aisle apart
with great power comes absolutely no responsibility for content
completely despondent and condescending
the king of nonsense and controversy is on a
beat killing spree your honor i must plead
guilty 'cause i sparked a revolution
rebel without a cause who caused the evolution of rap
to take it to the next level boost it
but several rebuked it and whoever produced it
 is that me it belongs to me
'cause i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
that don't honk but every time i speak you hear a beep
but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper
rappers better stay clear of me bitch
'cause it's the
it's the time of the season when hate runs high
and this time i won't give it to you easy
when i take back what's mine with pleasured hands
and torture everyone that is my plan my job here isn't done
'cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing
 shady
 i dont give a fuck but i wonder
 doubt it ha
so yeah dad let's walk
let's have us a father and son talk
but i bet we wouldn't probably get one block
without me knocking your block off
this is all your fault
maybe that's why i'm so bananas
i appeal to all those walks of life
whoever had strife
maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'cause i related to the struggles of young america
when their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
now they're ripping out their fucking hair again
it's hysterical i chuckle
'cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
yeah uh oh better beware knuckle heads
the sign on my hustle says don't knock
the doors broken it won't lock
it might just fly open get cold - cocked
you critics come pay to me a visit
misery loves company please stay a minute
kryptonite to a hypocrite
zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
too busy getting stoned in your glass house
to kick rocks then you wonder why i lash out
mister mathers as advertised on the flyers
so spread the word 'cause i'm promoting my passion 'til i'm passed out
completely brain dead rainman
doing the bankhead in a restraint chair
so bitch shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
or get shanked in the pancreas i'm angrier than
all 8 of the reindeer put together with chief keef
'cause i hate every fucking thing yeah
even this rhyme bitch and quit tryna look
for a fucking reason for it that aingt there
i still am a criminal
ten year old degenerate grabbing on my genitals
the last mathers lp done went diamond
this time i'm predicting this one will go emerald
when will the madness end how can it when
there's no method the pad and pen
the only message that i have to send
is dad i'm back at it again
bitch 
you fucking groupie pick up the goddamn phone
bitch where the fuck were you tuesday with who you say
i wasn't at the studio bitch what'cha do screw dre

go smurf yourself you make me wanna smurf and puke blue kool aid
here's what you say to someone you hate
my life would be so much better if you'd just drop dead
i was laying in bed last night thinking and this thought just popped in my head
and i thought wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead i would feel so much better
think i just relapsed this bitch pushed me over the brink
hop on the freeway trying to get some time alone and just think
till the cops pulled me over but they let me go 'cause i told 'em i'm only driving drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink
i'm back on my fuck hoe's with a whole new hatred for blondes
but bias i hate all bitches the same baby come on
excuse the pun but bitch is such a 'broad' statement and i'm
channeling my anger through every single station that's on
'cause a woman broke my he - art i say he - art
'cause she ripped it in two pa - arts and threw it in the garbage
who you think you a - are bitch
guess it's time for me to get the dust off and pick myself up off the carpet
but i'll never say the l word again
i lo - lo - lo - lo lesbian
aaahhh i hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
my life'd be so much better if you just
'cause you told me you'd love me forever bitch that was a lie
now i never wanted someone to die so bad in my fucking life
but fuck it there's other fish in the sea
and i'm a have a whale of a time being a single sailor
for the night bitch on a scale a
one to ten shit i must be the holy grail of
catches hoe i got an oscar attached to my fucking name 
i might hit the club find a chick that's tailor
made for me say fuck it kick some shots back git hammered and nail her
these bitches trying get attached but there failing to latch onto the tail of
my bumper they're scratching at the back of my trailer
like i'm itching to get hitched yeah i'm rich as a bitch
but bitches aingt shit i'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
bitch you complain when you listen to this
but you still throw yourself at me that's what i call pitching a bitch
that's why i'm swinging at these chicks on - site
long as i got a bat and two balls it's 'foul' but my dicks on 'strike'
so all that love shit is null and void bitch i'm a droid
i avoid cupid stupid wasn't for blow jobs you'd be unemployed

have a heart attack and just
drop dead and i'm a throw a fucking party after this
'cause yes
i'm just playing bitch you know i love you
this is survival of the fittest
this is do or die
this is the winner takes it all
so take it all
wasn't ready to be no millionaire i was ill - prepared
i was prepared to be ill though the skill was there
from the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends
it was 'bout busting raps and standing for something fucking acronym
cut the fucking act like you're happy i'm fucking back again
with another anthem why stop when it doesn't have to end
it aingt over 'til i say it's over  -  enough when i say enough
throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
i'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
when the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit i salivate at it
wait is up hands up like it's 12 noon nah homie
hold them bitches straighter up wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
came up rough came to ruffle feathers nah egos
i aingt deflate enough last chance to make this whole stadium erupt cause
i can see the finish line with each line that i finish
i'm so close to my goals i can almost pole vault over the goal post
and if i don't got enough in the tank maybe i can just siphon enough
to fill up this last can man will i survive in this climate or what
they said i was washed up and got a blood bath
i'm not a rapper i'm an adapter i can adjust
plus i can just walk up to a mic and just bust
so floor's open if you'd like to discuss
top 5 in this motherfucker and if i don't make the cut
what like i give a fuck i will light this bitch up like i'm driving a truck
to the side of a pump 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
like g - unit without the hyphen i'm hyping 'em up
and if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
and i look like i might just give up eh might've mistook
me for bowing out i aingt taking a bow i'm stabbing myself
with a fucking knife in the gut while i'm wiping my butt
cause i just shitted on the mic and i like getting cut
i get excited at the sight of my blood you're in a fight with a nut
cause i'm a fight 'til i die or win
biting the dust it'll just make me angrier wait
let me remind you of what got me this far picture me quitting
now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
it's survival of what
so get your ideas stack your ammo
but don't come unless you come to battle i'm mad now jump in the saddle
this is it it's what you eat sleep piss and shit
live breathe your whole existence just consists of this
refuse to quit fuse is lit can't diffuse the wick
i don't do this music shit i lose my shit
aingt got shit to lose it's the moment of truth
it's all i know how to do as soon as i get thrown in the booth i spit
but my respect is overdue i'm showing you the flow no one do
cause i don't own no diploma for school i quit
so there's nothing for me to fall back on i know no other trade
so you better trade your fucking mics in for some tool - box - es
cause you'll never take my pride from me
it'll have to be pried from me so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
but i want you to doubt me i don't want you to believe
cause this is something that i must use to succeed
and if you don't like me then fuck you
self esteem must be fucking shooting through - the - roof cause trust me
my skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me
i can see why the fuck i disgust you
i must be allergic to failure cause every time i come close to it
i just sneeze but i just go achoo then achieve
tell me where to go tell me what to do
i'll be right there for you
tell me what to say no matter if it's true
i'll say it all for you
i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
why am i so differently wired am i a martian
what kind of twisted experiment am i involved in
'cause i don't belong in this world
that's why i'm scoffing at authority defiant often
flying off at the handle at my mom no dad
so i am non - compliant at home at school i'm just shy and awkward
and i don't need no goddamn psychologist
tryna diagnose why i have all these underlying problems
thinking he can try and solve them
i'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
and in the front drive talking to myself
either that or inside hiding off in the corner somewhere quiet
trying not to be noticed 'cause i'm crying and sobbing
i had a bad day at school so i aingt talking
some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
'cause he said that i eyeballed him
and if you fall i'll get you there
i'll be your savior from all the wars that are fought
inside your world
please have faith in my words
'cause this is my legacy legacy eh
this is my legacy legacy eh
there's no guarantee
it's not up to me
we can only see
this is my legacy legacy
legacy legacy
why am i so differently wired in my noggin
'cause sporadic as my thoughts come it's mind boggling
'cause i obsess on everything in my mind small shit
bothers me but not my father he said sayonara then split
but i don't give a shit i'm fine long as
there's batteries in my walkman nothing's the matter with me
shit look on the bright side at least i aingt walking
i bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
complex on a ten speed which i've acquired parts that i
find in the garbage a frame then put tires on it
headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
but if this is all there is for me life offers
why bother even try and put up a fight it's nonsense
but i think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
what about them rhymes i've been jotting
they're kinda giving me confidence
instead of tryna escape through my comics
why don't i just blast a little something like onyx
to put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
say what i wanna say to the kid that said that i eyeballed him
grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
who would've knew from the moment i turned the mic on that
i could be iconic and my conquest
is word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest
now i think the fact that i'm differently wired's awesome
'cause if i wasn't i wouldn't be able to work
words like this and connect lines like crosswords
and use my enemy's words as strength
to try and draw from and get inspired off em
'cause all my life i was told and taught i am not shit
by you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
now you shut up bitch i am talking
thought i was full of horseshit and now
you fucking worship the ground in which i am walking
me against the world so what i'm brian dawkins
versus the whole 0 and 16 lions offense
so bring on the giants falcons and miami dolphins
it's the body bag game bitch i'm supplying coffins
'cause you dicks butt kiss a bunch of brian baldingers
you gon' die a ball licker i've been diabolical
with this dialogue since 99 rawkus
you don't respect the legacy i leave behind y'all can
suck a dick the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
in a flying saucer full of italian sausage
the most high exalting and i aingt halting
till i die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
the best part about me is i am not you
i'm me and i'm the fire marshall and this is my
legacy legacy eh
there's no guarantee it's not up to me we can only see
came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
an asshole that role think i succeeded fulfilling
but don't think i ever stopped to think that i was speaking to children
everything was happening so fast it was like i blinked sold 3 million
then it all went blank all i remember is feeling ridiculous 'cause i was getting sick of this feeling
like i'm always under attack man i coulda stacked my shit list to the ceiling
women dishing but really
thinking if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him
guess i'm a little bit of a hypocrite when i'm ripping shit but since when did this many
people ever give a shit what i had to say it's just my opinion
if it contradicts how i'm living put a dick in your rear - end
that's why every time you mention a lyric
i thanked you for it for drawing more attention toward it
'cause it gave me an enormous platform i'm flattered you thought i was that important
but you can't ignore the fact that i fought for the respect and battled for it
mad awards had glaad annoyed atta - boy
they told me to slow down i'd just zone - out
good luck trying to convince a blonde it's like telling gwen stefani that she sold out
'cause i was trying to leave no doubt
in anyone's mind one day i'd go down in history think they know now
because everybody knows
everybody knows that you're just an asshole
everywhere that you go people want to go home everyone knows
everybody knows so don't pretend to be nice
there's no place you can hide you are just an asshole
everyone knows everyone knows
thanks for the support asshole 
quit acting salty i was counting on you to count me out
ask asher roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out
thought i was history well god damn honky that compliment's like back - handing a donkey good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
nah i'm off him but what the fuck's all this trash talking about
the fight was fixed i'm back and you can't stop me you knocked me down
i went down for the count i fell but the fans caught me and now
you're gonna have to beat the fucking pants off me to take my belt
word to pacquiao mama said there aingt nothing else to talk about
better go in that ring and knock 'em out or you better not come out
it's poetry in motion like freddie roach when he's quoting
shake - speare so what if insults are revolting
even helen keller knows life stinks
you think it's a joke 'till your bullet riddled but you should give little shit what i think
this whole world is a mess
gotta have a goddamn vest
on your chest
and a glock just to go watch batman
who needs to test a testicles not that man
half you don't got the guts intestinal blockage rest of you got lap bands
stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts in all those
water bottles in colorado so get lost waldo my soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping
a black hole and i'm swallowing this track whole better pack toilet paper
but i'm taking no crap hoe here i go down the bat pole and i'm changing back into that ole maniac in fact there they go trying to dip out the back door retreating
'cause everybody knows
holy mackerel i'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth i smacked a girl
off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
for thinking we had some magnetic pull
then screamed icp in this bitch how do fucking magnets work
'cause you're attractive but we aingt attractable
hate to be dramatical but i'm not romantical
i'm making up words so you can understandable
it's tragical thinking some magical shit's gonna happen that aingt practical
you cracking a joke it's laughable
'cause me and love's like a bad combination i keep them feelings locked in a vault so it's safe to say i'm uncrackable
my heart is truly guarded
full body armor bitch you just need a helmet 'cause if you think you special you're retarded
thinking you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
you're a trainwreck i got a one - track mind and shorty you're fine but you sorta remind me of a 49'er
'cause you've been a gold digger since you was a miner
been trying to hunt me down like a dog 'cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
'cause all of my spare time's spent
on my nose in this binder so don't bother trying
only women that i love are my daughters but sometimes i rhyme
and it sounds like i forget i'm a father and i push it farther so father forgive me if i forget to draw the line
it's apparent i shouldn't have been parent i'll never grow up so to hell with your parents and 'mother' fuck 'father' time
it aingt never gonna stop a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime
so even if i'm half - dead i'm half alive
poured my half - empty glass in a cup now my cup has runneth over
and i'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster
i'm going back to what got me here yeah cocky and
can't knock being rudolph so fear not my deer
and dry up your tear drops i'm here
white america's mirror so don't feel awkward or weird
if you stare at me and see yourself 'cause you're one too shouldn't be a shock be
now this shit's about to kick off this party looks wack
let's take it back to straight hip - hop and start it from scratch
i'm 'bout to bloody this track up everybody get back
that's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra - ag
just like i did with addiction i'm 'bout to kick it
like a magician critics i turn to crickets

but quick to get impaled when i tell 'em stick it
so sick i'm looking pale wait that's my pigment
'bout to go ham ya bitch shout out to kendrick
let's bring it back to that vintage slim bitch
the art of mcing mixed with da vinci and mc ren

so turn the volume loud cause it's mayhem 'til the am
so baby make just like k - fed and let yourself go let yourself go
say fuck it before we kick the bucket
life's too short to not go for broke
so everybody everybody  shake your body
guess it's just the way that i'm dressed aingt it
khaki's pressed nike shoes crispy and fresh laced so i guess it aingt
that aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
plus i showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
so if love is a chess game check mate
but girl your body's banging jump me in dang bang - bang
yes siree 'bob' i was thinking the same thang
so come get on this kid's rock baw with da baw dang - dang
pow - pow chica pow chica wow - wow

question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
hope so now hoe
so crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go let yourself go
and they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
all i know is i fell asleep and woke up in that monte carlo
with the ugly kardashian
lamar oh sorry yo we done both set the bar low
far as hard drugs are though that's the past
but i done did enough codeine to knock future into tomorrow
and girl i aingt got no money to borrow
but i am trying to find a way to get you a - loan 
oh marshall mathers
shit head with a potty mouth get the bar of soap lathered
kangols and car - heart - less cargos
girl you're fixing to get your heart broke
don't be absurd ma'am you birdbrain baby
i aingt called anybody baby since birdman unless you're a swallow
word rick word man you heard but don't get discouraged girl
this is your jam unless you got toe jam
look i was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
but i'm only going to get this one chance
something's wrong i can feel it
just a feeling i've got
like something's about to happen
but i don't know what
if that means what i think it means we're in trouble
big trouble and if he is as bananas as you say
i'm not taking any chances
you were just what the doctor ordered
i'm beginning to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
they said i rap like a robot so call me rap - bot
but for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
i got a laptop in my back pocket
my pen'll go off when i half - cock it
got a fat knot from that rap profit
made a living and a killing off it
ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica lewinski feeling on his nutsack
i'm an mc still as honest
but as rude and as indecent as all hell
syllables skill - a - holic 
this flippity dippity - hippity hip - hop
you don't really wanna get into a pissing match
with this rappity - rap
packing a mack in the back of the ac
backpack rap crap yap - yap yackety - yack
and at the exact same time
i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicing that
i'll still be able to break a motherfucking table
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
only realized it was ironic
i was signed to aftermath after the fact
how could i not blow all i do is drop f bombs
feel my wrath of attack
rappers are having a rough time period
here's a maxi - pad
it's actually disastrously bad
for the wack while i'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah
'cause i'm beginning to feel like a rap god rap god
let me show you maintaining this shit aingt that hard that hard
everybody want the key and the secret to rap
immortality like i have got
well to be truthful the blueprint's
simply rage and youthful exuberance
everybody loves to root for a nuisance
hit the earth like an asteroid
and did nothing but shoot for the moon since 
mc's get taken to school with this music
'cause i use it as a vehicle to 'bus the rhyme'
now i lead a new school full of students
me me i'm a product of rakim
lakim shabazz 2pac n - w - a cube hey doc ren
yella eazy thank you they got slim
inspired enough to one day grow up
blow up and being in a position
to meet run - dmc and induct them
into the motherfucking rock n'
roll hall of fame even though i walk in the church
and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame i'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
on the wall of shame
you fags think it's all a game
'til i walk a flock of flames
off a plank and
tell me what in the fuck are you thinking
little gay looking boy
so gay i can barely say it with a 'straight' face looking boy
you're witnessing a mass - occur like you're watching a church gathering
and take place looking boy
oy vey that boy's gay
that's all they say looking boy
you get a thumbs up pat on the back
and a way to go from your label every day looking boy
hey looking boy what d'you say looking boy
i get a hell yeah from dre looking boy
i'mma work for everything i have
never asked nobody for shit
git out my face looking boy
basically boy you're never gonna be capable
of keeping up with the same pace looking boy 'cause
the way i'm racing around the track call me nascar nascar
dale earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god
kneel before general zod this planet's krypton no asgard asgard
so you'll be thor and i'll be odin
you rodent i'm omnipotent
let off then i'm reloading
immediately with these bombs i'm toting
and i should not be woken
i'm the walking dead
but i'm just a talking head a zombie floating
but i got your mom deep throating
i'm out my ramen noodle
we have nothing in common poodle
i'm a doberman pinch yourself
in the arm and pay homage pupil
it's me
my honesty's brutal
but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize
what i do though for good
at least once in a while so i wanna make sure
somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle
enough rhymes to
maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few punchlines
just in case 'cause even you unsigned
rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
i know there was a time where once i
was king of the underground
but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind
so i crunch rhymes
but sometimes when you combine
appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come trying to
censor you like that one line i said
on i'm back from the mathers lp
one when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine
put 'em all in a line
add an ak - 47 a revolver and a nine
see if i get away with it now
that i aingt as big as i was but i'm
morphing into an immortal coming through the portal
you're stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though
and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
you're pointless as rapunzel
with fucking cornrows
you write normal fuck being normal
and i just bought a new ray gun from the future
just to come and shoot ya
like when fabulous made ray j mad
'cause fab said he looked like a fag
at mayweather's pad singing to a man
while he play piano
man oh man that was the 24/7 special
on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to radio station the very next day
hey fab i'mma kill you
lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed 
uh summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming i'm a human
what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman
innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is
ricochet in off a me and it'll glue to you
and i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating
how to give a motherfucking audience a feeling like it's levitating
never fading and i know that haters are forever waiting
for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating
'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated
i make elevating music
you make elevator music
oh he's too mainstream
well that's what they do
when they get jealous they confuse it
it's not hip hop it's pop
'cause i found a hella way to fuse it
with rock shock rap with doc
throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it
i don't know how to make songs like that
i don't know what words to use
let me know when it occurs to you
while i'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurting you
how many verses i gotta murder to
prove that if you were half as nice
your songs you could sacrifice virgins to
unghh school flunky pill junky
but look at the accolades these skills brung me
full of myself but still hungry
i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to
when i'm a million leagues above you
ill when i speak in tongues
but it's still tongue - and - cheek fuck you
i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel
i'm asleep in the front seat
bumping heavy d and the boys
still chunky but funky
but in my head there's something
i can feel tugging and struggling
angels fight with devils and
here's what they want from me
they're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i had
then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
and understand the discrimination
but fuck it
life's handing you lemons
make lemonade then
but if i can't batter the women
how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then
don't mistake him for satan
it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas
and take a vacation to trip a broad
and make her fall on her face and
don't be a retard be a king
think not
why be a king when you can be a god
eminem has a full line of chainsaws
eminem eminem eminem eminem eminem eminem
marshall mathers eminem the rapper eminem
who can say fore sure
perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
if science can operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
society will reap a great benefit
i walk around like a space cadet place your bets
who's likely to become a serial killer case of tourettes
fuck fuck fuck can't take the stress
i make a mess as the day progresses angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
like this is how i'll cut your face up bitches with these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges
imagination's dangerous it's
the only way to escape this mess and make the best of this situation i guess
'cause i feel like a little bitch this predicament's
despicable i'm sick of just getting' pushed it's ridiculous
i look like a freaking wuss a pussy this kid just took
my stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
i wanna kick his tush but i was six and shook
this fucker was twelve and was six foot with a vicious hook
he hit me i fell i got back up all i did was book now there's using your head
mama always said
if you had a brain you'd be dangerous a brain you'd be dangerous
i'm a prove you wrong
mama i'm a grow one day to be famous and i'm a be a pain in the anus
i'm a be the bomb
i'm a use my head as a weapon find a way to escape this insaness
mama always said son if you had a brain you'd be dangerous guess it pays to be brainless
fast forward some years later a teenager this is fun sweet
i just got jumped twice in one week it's complete
it's usually once a month this is some feat
i've accomplished they stomped me into the mud gee for what reason you stumped me
but how do you get the shit beat outta you beat down and be up beat when you don't have nothing
no valid shot at life chance to make it or succeed
'cause you're doomed from the start it's like you grew up on jump street from jump street
but if i could just get my head out my ass
i could accomplish any task
practicing trash talking
in a trance locked in my room yeah but i got some plans mama
these damn rhymes are failing outta my pants pocket i can't stop it
and i'm starting to blend in more
in school this shit helps for sure i'm getting more self assured then i've ever been before
plus no one picks on me anymore i done put a stop to that threw my first punch -  end of story
still in my skull's a vacant empty void been using it more as a bin for storage
take some inventory
in this gourde there's a ford engine door hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a ninja sword
not to mention four linchpins an astringent stored
ironing board a bench a wrench a ore wench an attention whore
everything but a brain but domes off the fucking chain like an independent store
something's wrong with my head
just think if i had a brain in it thank god that i don't cause i'd probably be dahmer 'cause mama always said
now my mom goes wahm - wahm - wahm
'cause i'm not that smart but i'm not dumb
i was on he bottom of the pile getting stomped
but somehow i came out on top
i told you one day i said they'd have that red carpet rolled out yo

motherfukin difficult yeah 'til then hopefully ya
little homos get over your fears and phobias
it's ok to be scared - straight they said i provoked queers
'til emotions evoke tears my whole career's
a stroke of sheer genius smoke and mirrors tactical practical jokes yeah

and if i stumble i won't crumble
i'll get back up and uhhh

a beautiful face is all that you have
cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
but you're all that i love
i grasp you can't leave
please stay here with me baby hold me please
but you left and you took everything i had left
and left nothing nothing for me
so please don't wake me from this dream baby
we're still together in my head
and you're still in love with me
'til i woke up to discover that that dream was dead
you walked out i almost died
it was almost a homicide that you caused cause i was so traumatized
felt like i was in for a long bus ride
i'd rather die than you not by my side
can't count how many times i vomited cried
go to my room turn the radio on and hide
thought we were bonnie and clyde
no on the inside you were jekyll and hyde i
felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
it was you and i why did i think it was ride or die
cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
it's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
other side of my back and stuck a spike too should've
put up more of a fight but i couldn't at the time
no one could hurt me like you could've
take you back now what's the likelihood of that
bite me bitch chew on a nineteen footer
cause this morning i finally stood up
held my chin up finally showed a sign of life in me for the
first time since you left me and left me with nothing but shattered dreams
and the life we could've had and we could've been
but i'm breaking out of this slump i'm in
pulling myself out of the dumps once again
i'm getting up once and for all fuck this shit
i'mma be late for the pity party
but you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chump - ions
i'm done being your punching bag
it was november 31st today would've been our anniversary
two years but you left on the first of may
i wrote it on a calender was gonna call but couldn't think of the words to say
but they came to me just now so i put 'em in a verse to lay
and i thank you  cause you made me  a better person than i was
but i hate you  cause you drained me 
i gave you all you gave me none
but if you blame me  you're crazy 
and after all is said and done
i'm still angry yeah i may be
i may never trust someone
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy yeah you think i'm crazy
i wanted the fame but not the cover of newsweek
oh well guess beggars can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
for wanting my cake and eat it too and wanting it both ways
fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
when i blew; see but it was confusing
'cause all i wanted to do is be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink used it as a tool when i blew steam 
hit the lottery oh wee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winning a used mink
ironic 'cause i think i'm getting so huge i need a shrink
i'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep two sheep
going cuckoo and cooky as kool keith
but i'm actually weirder than you think
'cause i'm
well that's nothing
now i aingt much of a poet but i know somebody once told me
to seize the moment and don't squander it
'cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
so i keep conjuring sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
yoda - loda - le - hee - hoo
i think it went wandering off down yonder
and stumbled on 'ta jeff vanvonderen
'cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
'cause the very thing that i love's killing me and i can't conquer it
my ocd's conking me in the head
keep knocking nobody's home i'm sleepwalking
i'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
don't shoot the messenger i'm just friends with the

one day that i'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then drums get killed and i'm coming straight at
mc's blood get spilled and i'll
take you back to the days that i'd get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that
pumped up feeling and shit to say back
to the kids who played him
i aingt here to save the fucking children
but if one kid out of a hundred million
who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great
it's payback russell wilson falling way back
in the draft turn nothing into something still can make that
straw into gold chump i will spin rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
maybe i need a straightjacket face facts
i am nuts for real but i'm okay with that
it's nothing i'm still friends with the
i own a mansion but live in a house
a king size bed but i sleep on the couch

but my tanks half - empty gasket just blew

thirty minutes from home gotta lay a log cabin only option i have's mcdonalds' bathroom
in a public stall dropping a football so every time someone walks in the john i get maddened
shady what up what come on man i'm crapping
and you're asking for my goddamn autograph on a napkin

to run out of tissue yeah hand me that on second though i'd be glad then
thanks dog names todd a big fan i
wiped my ass with it crumbled it up in a wad threw it back and
told 'im todd you're the shit when's all of this crap end
can't pump my gas without causing an accident
pump my gas cut my grass i can't take out the fucking trash
without someone passing through my sub harassing
i'd count my blessings but i suck at math
i'd rather wallow than bask suffering succotash but the ant - 
acid it gives my stomach gas
when i mix my corn with my fucking mashed
potatoes so what hoe kiss my country bumpkin ass
missouri southern roots what the fuck is upper class

stuck in the past ipod what the fuck is that
b - boy to the core mule i'm as stubborn as
maybe that's why it feels so strange
got it all but i still won't change
maybe that's why i can't leave detroit
it's the motivation that keeps me going
this is the inspiration i need
i could never turn my back on a city that made me
and life's been good to me so far
they call me classless i heard that i second and third that don't know what the fuck i'd be doing if it weren't rap

creature of habit feel like i'm trapped in an animal shelter

after the dillinger hit him diligently and killing 'im

as marshall would you give fellatio in the carpool

meanwhile ya chasing her
chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her pity the fool and pity the fool in me i'm a live with the
game of love love love love la - la - la - la - la love
so needless to say i'm feeling betrayed snatch my house key off her key chain
she jumps off 'wee - bey' from the wire's dick now she's chasing me with a cheese grater
here goes that broken record cliche it's all my fault anyway she's turning the tables i'm a beat - break
she treats my face like serato she cuts and scratches like a deejay each day is an instant replay
they say what we display is symptomatic of attack behave
ior back together but forgot today was her b - day
she cut me off on the freeway
simple misunderstanding but just as i went to slam on the brakes that's when i realized that she may be crazy as me wait
bitch cut my fucking brake line stepped on them fuckers eight times still going 73 thank
god there's an exit coming up what the mother f - u - cock's
wrong with her hit the off - ramp 'til i coasted to a god damn halt hit a fucking tree now here she comes at full speed she's racing at me ok you wanna fuck with me 'eh
snatch that bitch out her car through the window she's screaming i body slam her on the cement until the concrete gave
and created a sink hole buried the stink hoe in it then paid to have the street repaved
woke up in a dream state
in a cold sweat like i got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
guess i eventually caved though cause she's laying next to me in bed
directly aiming a gat at my head
woke up again and jumped up like fuck it i've had it i'm checking into rehab
i confess i'm a static addict i guess
that's why i'm so clingy every girl i've ever had either says
i got too much baggage or i'm too fucking dramatic man what the fuck is the matter i'm just
a fucking romantic i fucking love you you fucking bitch combative possessive in fact last time i was mad at an ex
i actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
i said hit the road then after she left i sent that bitch a text
that said be careful driving don't read this and have an accident  she glanced to look at it and wrecked
too bad thought we had a connect -  no sense dwelling makes
never been a more compelling case than the model covered in l'oreal and mace
who fell from grace eleven stories for story telling while the whore was yelling rape
till her vocal chords were swelling and her voice was more horser than tori spellings' face
still they swarm the gates
of my fancy estates to greet norman bates with a warm embrace
less your andrea yates don't ask me for a date though you're late well the sentiment's great
but wait think there's been a mistake
you wanted an intimate date i wanna intimidate
i have infinite hate in my blood
it's mainly cause of the game of
 wait dinner at eight
and it's mainly cause of the game of love
love love love
la - la - la - la - la love
mom i know i let you down
and though you say the days are happy
why is the power off and i'm fucked up
and mom i know he's not around
but don't you place the blame on me
as you pour yourself another drink yeah
i guess we are who we are
headlights shining in the dark night i drive on
maybe we took this too far
i went in headfirst
never thinking about who what i said hurt in what verse
my mom probably got it the worst
the brunt of it but as stubborn as we are
did i take it too far
cleaning out my closet and all them other songs
but regardless i don't hate you 'cause ma
you're still beautiful to me 'cause you're my mom
though far be it from you to be calm our house was vietnam
desert storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare
and forever we can drag this on and on
but agree to disagree
that gift from me up under the christmas tree don't mean shit to me
you're kicking me out it's 15 degrees and it's christmas eve 
ma let me grab my fucking coat anything to have each other's goats
why we always at each other's throats
especially when dad he fucked us both
we're in the same fucking boat you'd think that it'd make us close 
further away it drove us but together headlights shine a car full of belongings
still got a ways to go back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
and i was the man of the house the oldest so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
then nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
and that's when i realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
and to this day we remained estranged and i hate it though but
'cause to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though
'cause you aingt even get to witness your grand babies grow
but i'm sorry mama for cleaning out my closet at the time i was angry
rightfully maybe so never meant that far to take it though
'cause now i know it's not your fault and i'm not making jokes
that song i no longer play at shows and i cringe every time it's on the radio
and i think of nathan being placed in a home
and all the medicine you fed us
and how i just wanted you to taste your own
but now the medications taken over
and your mental state's deteriorating slow
and i'm way too old to cry the shit is painful though
but ma i forgive you so does nathan yo
all you did all you said you did your best to raise us both
foster care that cross you bear few may be as heavy as yours
but i love you debbie mathers oh what a tangled web we have
'cause one thing i never asked was
where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
fuck it i guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
but i'd have flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus
own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
someone ever moved them from me that you coulda bet your asses
if i had to come down the chimney dressed as santa kidnap them
and although one has only met their grandma once
you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
me her and nate we introduced you hugged you
and as you left i had this overwhelming sadness come over me
as we pulled off to go our separate paths
and i saw your headlights as i looked back
and i'm mad i didn't get the chance to thank you for being my mom and my dad
so mom please accept this as a tribute i wrote this on the jet
i guess i had to get this off my chest
i hope i get the chance to lay it before i'm dead
the stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt i guess we're crashing
so if i'm not dreaming i hope you get this message that i'll always love you from afar
'cause you're my ma
i want a new life 
one without a cause 
so i'm coming home tonight 
well no matter what the cost
and if the plane goes down
or if the crew can't wake me up
well just know that i'm alright
i was not afraid to die
oh even if there's songs to sing
well my children will carry me
just know that i'm alright
because i put my faith in my little girls
so i never say goodbye cruel world
i am not afraid to die
i want a new life
yeah trying to figure out the difference
but i think i think the lines are starting to get blurry
i'm in a strange place
i feel like mace when he gave up the game for his faith
i feel like i'm caged in these chains and restraints
grimming every stranger in the place while i gaze into space
'cause i'm mentally rearranging his face
i need a change of pace 'cause the pace i'm working at is dangerous
there's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
i done quit chicken heads in cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em
'cause that's where most of my anger is based
fuck your feelings i feel like i play for the saints
i just want to hurt you aim for the skanks
then aim for all these fake kanye's jay's wayne's and the drake's
i'm frustrated 'cause aingt no more n'sync now i'm all out of whack
i'm all out of backstreet boys to call out and attack
i'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is
i'm strapped for battle sucka - duck crawl out the back its a bar fight
prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air
and bottles breaking mirrors also
and i aingt stopping 'til the swear jar's full
you done called every woman a slut but you forgetting sarah marshall 
oh my bad slut
and next time i show up to court i'll be naked and just wear a lawsuit
judge be like that's sharp how much that motherfucker cost you
smart ass you're lucky i don't tear it off you
and jump your bones you're sexy motherfucker
you're so fucking gravy marshall i should start calling you au jus
'cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
evil twin take this beat now it's all you
i believe people can change but only for the worse
i could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
so satanic k - mart chains panic
'cause they can't even spin back the curse words
'cause they're worse when they're reversed motherfucker
and these kids are like parrots
they run around the house just like terrorists
screaming fuck shit fuck
adult with a childish - like arrogance
wild ever since the day i came out i was like merits fuck that
i'd rather be loud and i like swearing
from the first album even the gals were like tight lyrics dreamy eyes
but my fucking mouth was nightmarish
and from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this
and the opposition felt the opposite
sometimes i listen and revisit them old albums
often as i can and skim through all them bitches
to make sure i keep up with my competition
 hogger of beats hoarder of rhymes
borderline genius who's bored of his lines
and that sort of defines where i'm at and the way i feel now
feel like i might just strike first and ignore the replies
theres darkness closing in 
there it goes again 
it controls my pen 
but that aint me its my evil twin
but hes just a friend 
who pops up now and again 
so dont blame me 
blame him its my evil twin
welcome back to the land of the living my friend
you have slept for quite some time
so who's left lady gaga mess with the bieber
nah f with christina i aingt fucking with either jessica neither
simpson or alba my albums just sicker than struck with the fever
get the chloraseptic excedrin aleve or extra strength tylenol 3s
feel like i'm burning to death but i'm freezing
bed - ridden and destined never to leave the
bedroom ever again like the legend of heather ledger
my suicide notes barely legible read the
bottom it's signed by the joker
lorraine said i never can leave her
she'd sever my wiener i ever deceive her
fuck that shit bitch
give up my dick for pussy i'd be jerry mathers
i'd ever left it to beaver
get them titties cut off trying to mess with a cleaver
golly - wally i bet he registered jesus
ever since 1 - 9 - 9 - 4 - 6 dresden it was definitely my destiny
when on the steps i met deshaun at osborn
i'd never make it to sophomore
i just wanted to skip school and rap used to mop floors
flip burgers and wash dishes while i wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em
'cause i took book - smarts and swapped for 'em
they were sleeping i made them stop snoring
made them break out the popcorn
now i've been hip hop in its tip top form
since nwa was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
screaming fuck the police like cop porn
flipped rap on its ear like i dropped coin
fuck top 5 bitch i'm top 4
and that includes biggie and pac whore
and i got an evil twin so who the fuck you think that's 3rd and that 4th spot's for
and crazy as i am i'm much tamer than him
and i'm nuts then again who the fuck wants to plain eminem
but no one's insaner than slim look at that evil grin 
please come in what was your name again
hi faggot
look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
two rabbits a koala bear and a ball of hair
and you're all aware i don't got it all upstairs
guess that's why i'm an addict and it's just small up there
peace to whitney geez just hit me
that i should call the loony police to come get me
'cause i'm so sick of being the truth i wish someoned finally admit me
to a mental hospital with britney
oh lmfao no way ho

you trying to hold hands with your homie
what you think i'm looking for romance 'cause i'm lonely

hoe i'm only vulnerable when i got a boner
superman tried to fuck me over it won't hurt
don't try to fix me i'm broke so i don't work
so are you but you're broke 'cause you don't work
but all bullshit aside i hit a stride
still shady inside hair every bit is dyed
as it used to be when i first introduced y'all to my skittish side
and blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
'cause we are the same bitch
one thousand different houses and munchhausen
i'mma make you wanna punch out some fucking one ouch
what the fuck'd you hit me for
scream life as i punch counter and bunches out of anger
i once encountered a stranger
in a dumb gown black hood
with a scythe
shit i laughed in his face spit
bitch gave me an extra life like take this
now get your ass back in that game bitch
don't take shit for granted
and don't take shit give it
only bull you should take is by the horns
a mixture of whitey ford and mighty thor
i everlast pen is mightier than sword
finish writing then record
replenish keep writing more
nothing's riding on it but your pride is all you're fighting for
so you fight scratch you claw
back's to wall
no one was there to catch you fall
you pick yourself back up you dust your jacket off
you grab your balls like they're gargantuan and
ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
pull out your pants for whooping ass and flash it on em'
nobodies gonna back you in the corner
you're a hornet
no one's more ig - norant then you fucking four in the morning you're at the laboratory storming
like there's nothing that's more important
mc's you better consider this a formal warning you're in for it
girl what would you do if i said your body was off the chain
and i told you i smile every single time i saw your face
i aingt finished bitch
i meant in half oil the blades
nobody wants to play
they say i'm a spoiled little baby
but
nobody puts baby in the corner
i'm only trying to warn ya
'cause that baby gets mad
and gets to throwing a tantrum
he'll fucking flip on ya
'cause nobody puts baby in the corner
what goes through an addict's brain
besides static pain and big daddy kane
break beats and words
an erratic train of thought
like splatter paint
scatter brain
yeah maybe that explains
why you're back but don't rap the same
and you're looking way thinner
because your hunger got you looking like
they took away dinner 
sugar ray leonard wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though
just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
when you say you're a chooka what chooka what
now fling that bitch from your fingertips
hope it lands on another rap singers lips
who can't think of shit
anything of wit that's interesting to spit
who's king of this fucking english lit
let your middle fingers flip
on each hand whilst extending this shit
how low can you go
lower than chuck d ho
hear the bass of this in my voice
rocky's back where's my adrian
nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
i'm what tom brady is to the patriots of rap
not a man i'm a weapon
who just happened to be a rapper
who just happen to be on the crapper
when it happened i had an epiphany
in the bathroom i'd never be the same after
now i'm back with an appe - tite
for destruction the fucking recipe for disaster
so let's eat cos' i'm famished
every deed is a dastardly one
evil its past it
even you asking for me to be
po - lite to people
is like me having my teeth pulled
so step inside of dimension
the demented side of a mind
that's like the inside of an engine
while i multiply your undivided attention
but be reminded that if i didn't mention
i lose my mind and my temper
you'll be the first one
who finds him offensive
got him climbing the fences
lost some time to addiction
but look up rhyme in the dictio - nary
i'm in the picture
eminem is the synonym for it
i'm an enigma
fuck it let's get to the meat balls
i'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes
edgamacater they are
shit legends are made of
spit treacherous data
shit that you would say to your worst enemy
this wretched is
what you get when you mix treach with a jada
and combine em' with method man and redman
with meth - amphetamines in his left hand
and in his right there's a sledge - hammer
and pajamas standing in front of a webcam
beating himself in the head til russell let's him off deaf jam
maybe i need my head examined
hannibal lecter with a dead lamb
hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
i need meds
swear to god 'cause if i go off the edge
ti aingt talking me off a ledge man
heart throb at a fart ah nah
more like a smart slob part blob
that'll stab you with a sharp ob - ject
to the heart and leave claw marks
all over the wal - mart walls
little baby with large balls
fuck mud slinging i'm blood flinging
there's nothing on this fucking earth better than being
the king of the playground
i hate the swings but i love being an underdog
cos when i'm pushed
i end up swinging up
girl you give me writer's block
i'm at a loss for words uhh
my mind's as lost as yours
i rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
never seen no ass as large as yours
how much that cost that's what i call the cost to splurge
you drive me bonkers im about to get my swerve on for sure
thought i was pimping 'til i felt like nas the first
date cause i think i gave you power when i gave you flowers in a vase
a box of chocolates throat lozengers cough drops and certs
probably should've never let me call that job of yours
to talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
should've been one of the first signs to cause alert
man we jumped in too fast cause since then i just can't be apart from her
cause nobody's body's awesomer i lust it and she loves me
cause i'm popular but you know this aingt love
you know this aingt love you know this aingt love
you know this aingt love you know this aingt love 
it's desperation 
you were obviously oblivious to me i swore i was just invisible to you
till i went to the lengths i did to meet you
cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
now i'm in disbelief i never knew that this could be such misery ah
cause now you see nothing but me and i don't see nothing but you
and i'm about to flip cause we are super glued in
we stuck to each other's hips and we can't
do anything individually which is to cling on scared to be alone
can't specifically describe it i just can't seem to give a reason
this definitive just need you talking bout i live and breathe you
and you pretend to be as mentally and physically
addicted to me as wiz khalifa is to reefer
don't wanna be without you
don't wanna be with you neither bitch
put me in a situation in which it's both i wish to seek
cause this aingt love
just want you to myself don't wanna share you with no one else
what the fuck you whispering for
you get on my nerves you make me sick
i think our relationship it seems to be on the fritz
i mean it's time that we just split and leave the
games behind your frame of mind aingt the same as mine
i think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too
get the picture
that's a negative alicia i will never give the keys up
to the crib ever again no reason not even a gift certificate from tiffany's
you better have an epiphany slut guess what the lease up
i'm just mad the time it took to discover
you were using me for loot like i used you for looks
oh thought you was too good for me huh yeah
toots used to be my carrie underwood i was your lumberjack
but i can't stomach this i'm leaving you i'm not coming back
she said the fuck with that where's my louisville slugger at
she grabbed that fucking bat and swung it at my head
i barely ducked and that's right
when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice steel toe
girl probably coulda put a 100 - yard field goal through the uprights
what is a nightmare the dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream a nightmare
i used to think i had bad luck but i wasn't superstitious
till one day i grew suspicious when i stepped on a crack on aunt edna's stoop
and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
then we flew the coop to michigan to start a new be - ditching
missouri from michigan didn't work
so we moved back to missouri from michigan from missouri back to michigan
someone put me out my misery i can't do this again
mom please stick to a decision
discipline last thing i wanna' do is listen she's like
lex luthor bitch her rules are kryptonite
so the walls and i done lost my power to see through them bitches
but i run into them running through the kitchen
pretending to be blind superman
cause i had no supervision
but i did have a super power though
i could turn into invisible kid
disappear out of sight like a true magician
and one day uncle ronnie brought over this new but different
music into the picture and it became my new religion
i remember it clearly even today
move back to michigan again to live with my grandma ned
always itching for something to do was flipping
through the radio stations one day
and discovered this dj who was mixing
i say it to this day if you aingt listened to the wizard
you aingt have a fucking clue what you was missing
i'd zone out with my headphones all i remember doing's wishing
for shoes fuck them stupid pumas bitch it's all about them new edition troops
you get the new ll cool j cooling system
made that final maneuver to 8 mile and hoover and somehow i saw my future is in this
that's how i knew my mission
little boom box booming spitting
practicing numerous rhythms
when i sit in my room envisioning my dreams come true for wishing
i remember proof would visit
couldn't wait to play him my new shit he'd go coocoo ballistic
go through the roof for his shit
it's like we knew the instant
we touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit
never quit too persistent
we are a rap empire
started a group of misfits
proof had a proposition
if we all band together there aingt no stopping this shit
come up with aliases bipolar opposites and
be ready to come off the top as sharp position
if you got dissed at the shop cause if they caught you slipping
they'd take your spot if someone got to ripping you
and you forgot your written
opportunity knocks once it aingt knocking again
they tried ding - dong ditching shit
i fucking got that bitch in a headlock
cut off his oxygen slim snot gourgin
cock sucking cynder block in the wind
now i got my pot to piss in
spot in that top position
copping over the opposition
looking like a dog that's pissing
leg up on the competition
promising complete dominance sugar ray robinson
i'm in a league muhammad's in
ali's my colleague bombing them
probably end up on top of them
stomping them like ndamukong
i'm rushing like a urkanian ladanian tomlinson
flow vomits in your face
competitors fall at my waist
you spit a rhyme i spit in a rhyme's face
so name the time place to battle
bitch i'm still in that mind state
don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
cry babies maybe my way that i use words is loose
but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
and the truth hurts shit no wonder you're sore losers
now where's your poop birds
ooh no more tripping in bird shit songs of self empowerment surgeon
words of encouragement but this discouraging the rappers
the rap games god but the name's not james todd i'm just a wordsmith
so let these words lift
cause all i got is bars for you dumbbells since yours aingt working out
each verse is more merciless than the first is
and you aingt got to wear no shoes and shirt in this beast to get served
blood thirst revenge of the nerds
chickit
and it's true you shall not escape my vengeance
and i'm the kid with them ears like dumbo's gone
word to uncle ron
i'm turning into a non - humble don
you blonde dumb hoes all i got is dick for you to come blow on
so stop the show but i need a drum roll 'fore i go on
better back away from the front row get gone
chomp your arm
bigger than dikembe mutumbo
i'm the fucking jumbo tron
i'm a juggernaut you do not wanna crumble you bambacluts
i'll leave you stretched out like a fucking yawn
so mow the fucking lawn your asses are blades of grass
and i'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
the goat just ate eight acres and ate the vet
who's just to make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
oh look my notebook looks smoke cooked
like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove soot
charred debris floating
like oak wood was burning
return of the no good
and i won't quit
and the next thing i know something came crawling up from below
something that made godzilla look like a plane
and i don't quit won't change
it's like a groundhog's day
so grab a hand ya'll cause you may see if i popped your head
i'm a heartless monster
turn me into
with my dick in your mouth all day
i'm not so sure i want to know from whence it came
but the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
there before that shimmering veil of light the ivory skin slug thing
i can feel the heat rising everything is on fire
today is a painful reminder of why
we can only get brighter
the further you put it behind ya
but right now i'm on the inside
i'm standing in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light
yesterday was the tornado warning
today's like the morning after
your world is torn in half
you wake in it's wake to start the mourning process
and rebuilding you're still a work in progress
today's a whole new chapter
it's like an enormous asth - ma
thunderstorm has passed ya
you weathered it and poked it's eye out
with the thorn bush that you
used to smell the roses
stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
so focused on the bright side
then you floor the gas pedal
and hit the corner fast the more asserted
never looking back
may hit the curb
but every day is a new learning curve as you
steer through life sometimes you might not wanna swerve
but you have to
to avert a disaster
lucky no permanent damage
cause they hurt you so bad
it's like they murdered your ass
and threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ashes
and that hurt that you have you just converted to gasoline
and while you're burning the past standing in the inferno and chant
you're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
it happens all the time they take your heart and steal your life
and it's as though you feel you've died
cause you've been killed inside
but yet you're still alive
which means you will survive
although today you may weep cause you're weakened
and everything seems so bleak and hopeless
the light that you're seeking
it begins to seep in
that's the only thing keeping
you from leaping off the mothafreaking deep end
and i'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
and with a little time that should do the healing
and by tomorrow
you may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em even after
all the shit you been put through this feeling of resilience is building
and the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
you're sealed in but you're fireproof flame retardant you withstood it
and as you climb up to the roof you're just chilling you look down
cause you're so over 'em
you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
as time passes
things change every day
but wounds wounds heal but scars still remain the same
but tomorrow today's going down in flames
throw the match set the past ablaze
so feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire
from the heat
exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
and as you say goodbye to the grief
it's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
but you've extinguished this living hell
still a little piece of you dies as you scream
i feel the burn watch the smoke as i turn
rising a phoenix from the flames
i have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
not with fists but with wings that i will fly
i'm getting by with my wicked ways
i'm loading up and i'm taking names
i wanna dig my way to hell
guess i got a way with words i could get away with murder
ever heard of aspergers' it's a rare condition
it's what you're suffering from
when you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
and you can't see the bitchs hair is frizzing
cause you got the windows up
blaring the system in your chevrolet prizm
the devil aingt on a level same as him
picture someone who revels in straight masochism
and imagine him giving an adjective an ass whooping
so bad they should put his ass in prison
a word bully i verbally abuse verbs
like they did something to me personally
used to get bullied so i'd cut class and ditch it
now i bully rap i'm the shit faggot 
cadillac from a k car
my ass from a hole in the ground still cant tell em a - part
came straight out the trailer park screaming i'm proud
to shop at k - mart and it became art
and i'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
to this day i still get in fights with the same broad
at the same walmart arguing over the same cart
in the middle of the aisle whiling
i don't give a fuck i don't play
bitch you think you saw this basket first
you're ass backwards like motherfucking bob and silent jay
illest shit you could think i would say
mind's like a pile of clay
when's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
ripped a gaping hole in it
flipped out ripped down the drapes
tied 'em around my neck
went down the fire escape of the empire state
slipped fell straight down to the ground
splattered all over the entire state
and straight to hell got impaled by the gates
saw satan stuck his face in an ashtray
while i sashayed around flames with a match and i gave him the gas face
and this aingt got nothing to do with a scale or being gay little faggot
but by the way thoughts are getting darker by the day
i'm a combination of skylar grey tyler the creator and violent j
it's a fucking miracle to be this lyrical
paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face i'm insane
every rhyme i say sons you like an ultra violet ray
im selling hatred buffet style all the shit you can eat
1199 so come on and pile a plate
im throwing down the gauntlet to see what hell i can raise
with the rhyme im spitting while im shitting on competition
in the meantime its always mean time
ive been a career asshole
i dont see why these people always got my back
i done said so much fucked up shit i was born a mistake
but i was put here not by accident
i had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
slaughter tracks i done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
im coming to get that quarter back
like ndamukong the drama can build
your mama can ask me for my autograph
cause that cougar's a milf she's the oldest trick in the book
but i sure would fall for that
you done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
when i get on the mic i'mma snap
make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
when i overdosed woulda caught a flat
if it makes you sick to your stomach acid
indigestion my suggestions kaopectate
if it feels like i'm running away with the game
it's cause i am don't speculate spectate
all i got is dick for days and insults for decades
but i get by with my wicked ways
lady you can suck a dick til your neck aches
cry til you get puffy eyes red faced
but i'm leaving on this jet plane
you aingt fly you're an airhead
and i'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole sorry another catchphrase
but your baggage aingt gonna fit in my storage overhead space
cause it just aingt big enough to fit your damaged goods
other words don't try to put your heart in a headcase
cause baby stable mentally i aingt
i need my meds i peed my bed
i'm going blind i don't see my legs
i keep on falling down no wonder you can't stand me i need my cane
someone help me i think my face is melting
if you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain
this g - i - a - n - t hole in my empty head
if you read my mind you can see my pain
and you'd see why i be this way
ever since i was knee high playing with gi joes
told these hoes shut their p - i - e holes now peep my game
cause i'm 'bout it 'bout it
like a  fucking 
echo   psycho on a cyclone cycle

pencil is full of insolent bullets
i'm like a doberman pinscher pitbull and a rott'
mixed with a toxic the plot begins to thicken
i begin to spitting like vintage pac demented
demonic sinister ever since the the doc replenished me
the day he gave me that shot when i was just 'bout to quit
so to not see him with me would be a shocking image
and i'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
and knock me to the canvas even the boxing critics
know that if i get off to a rocky start i'll always have a rocky finish
eat me brocoli spinach cocky nope
but i hope i offended you when i told ya how dope i am at this
and put emphasis on the dope so when names come up
in that conversation of who's the dopest better throw mine in it
and don't mind me while i remind you of the flow
you won't find anywhere where it fires and i unload my pen explodes
'til there's no rhymes in it reload in no time
let insults fly even sixty seconds that go by so you know i meant it
in school i was so shy timid
two pairs of jean's i'd alternate bummy clothes i 'member
begging my mom for k - mart macgregors cause they were new
st vincent de paul those pony's were used and no size fitted
but kissed them old days adios i did it
they said i was a gimmick now i'm the one that those guys mimic
now you fuckers don't wanna go starting no argument
cause you know i'll win it name a flow that's more authentic and don't front
don't front you know i got you open kid
rest in piece to big proof you was a beast you lyrically mirrored me
molded my flow off of you your spirit's flowing through me
i love you doody without you i feel so incomplete
i'm no king no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
i'm a thorn in your side get thrown into a throne
better watch the fucking tone that you speak feel like i'm in the zone
i'm in a whole different league on my mothafucking own it's just me
no opponents can compete and i've never been known to retreat
from beef beep - beep follow trends or wallow in defeat
i'm still hungry as fuck but can't even say bon appetit
cause i don't know what to eat fucking microphone or the beat
bitch nobody's mind works like mine
it's nose to the grindstone time holmes your mind's blown
cause i rhyme like i'm still trying to get signed up in the ebony show -

never asked you like my shit from the get
i'd rather ask you to wipe my ass bitch

cause on the mic i gotta represent the real rappers
the real rappers get their mothafucking skills cracking
word to buckshot and dru - ha why the fuck not

before i signed with the doc i almost signed with duck down
cause rawkus didn't make no offers so mothafuck loud
they jerked me around so what's up now
wow how much of an asshole would i sound like
rubbing it and holding some grudge now but don't front
late at night used to catch a buzz couldn't write
now i write the type of shit to make you wipe
but wear diapers cause you might leave a streak
i'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe
it's hard to decipher what cypher i might jump into tonight
cause i'm hyper or something needing someone or something is lighting
this fire under me it's breathing new life it's like i already died once
i guess some people only live twice and it's funny
my days of being broke was so long ago i lost my concept of money
but you dimes won't get a fucking nickle from me
oh shit i'm down on one knee
i'm having a stroke of genius elizabeth i'm coming to you honey
from boy to man it's still make a whore moan like a thyroid gland
i'm in another category man don't put me up with them pop stars
i never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy band
no offense yes offense precedents has been set that'll never get met
middle finger pressed against moby's nose
shouts to obie the curtains closed on my show
you can't take it oh
got a whole generation of rappers coming up that are nutty with the flow
but convince me you've heard
an mc since me who's this good with the fucking mincing of words
without mincing words that'll make you feel like i'm pinching a nerve
whose mentally disturbed you might as well stick a knife in me and turn
it'll be like my skin being indian burned
hah bitch there isn't one when will you learn
never been served if memory serves
i'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words
you know i got you open kid stop fronting
you know i got you open word life
i'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
i disgust you like dialogue from the shop to the wired frog
night club shit i was taught if your cd's on fire
you had to put it out yourself like highland park no fire department
so you might not hear sirens at all
but don't be alarmed if i sound off
something just aingt right with me dawg
a martyr on a private charter whose life could be harder
widely regarded highly bite me sweetheart i'm slightly retarded
but tonight i'm starting shit i'm feeling self righteous
i might just hop in a mosh pit on some mike tyson and pac shit
looking to box with anybody disorderly conduct
i'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
fan of the lox bananas manic i'm going in shock
frantic i'm trapped in a closet
panic attack cause i'm claustrophobic
no faggot i mean i can't maneuver from movement
cause i have no room for improvement
i'm practically squashed unpacked it and boxed it
toxic hands are arsenic flammable bars examine the content
bar exam start of insanity
charles hamilton slash manson and bronson
animal snarls cannibal jaws
shark mandibles lambs to the slaughter
looking scamp as hannibal stalking
anthony hopkins with his hands in his pockets
black out zach galifianakis gallons of vodka
but that gal has some knockers
i bet you they ring a bell when i come back and i'm conscious
what happened doc i passed out again
alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked
stole a magnum box and bag cirocs in back of a datsun
fell asleep watching fear factor and scare tactics
too close to the stairmaster
poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
woke up shortly thereafter hungover
no underwear grasping a bayer aspirin and dropped it
air max in my closet preposterous nikes made out of ostrich
and the cross stitching is a cross mixing
of a rhinoceros possum skin giraffe and a dolphin
fin dockers oshkoshes drop crotches
swatch watches and sneakers matches with the parkers
but it's like being overstaffed at a boxing gym
with all these trainers but i don't have any boxers
and i'm standing here naked hangover still wasted
like paper you write raps on obnoxious
yo why does it always sound like i'm grabbing my nostrils
fuck that i'll battle 'em all i'll battle a mall
ill stand there and yell that at a wall
until the mannequin doll scatter and the inanimate objects
that i'm battering all shatter and fall
cause i hear the track and i'm starting to get fucking amped
i'mma spark plug i'm like the car with the cables hooked up to my fucking back i'm a duracell
but i sure as hell got it backwards cause y'all could get jumped
and i'd catch the battery charge but
i got a hunch like your back when it's arching
when i start attacking your squadron
you'll feel like mastercard when i'm charging
so take a swipe at me i'm coming straight at you
like clay matthews from the green bay packers
so get the sack of wisconsin

in a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
affable guy next door is laughable
my next whore's gonna have mechanical arms
that'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
no emotion hence i guess this sick prick dies hard
i got a magic johnson
it's like a magic wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
if ronda rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
holding a thousand magnums at once to pounce me
i'll laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
and all i see is paulie malign now she's slaughterhouse in a blouse
and madonna with mud on her god dammit i am misogynist
i slap linda ronstadt with a lobster throw her off a balcony

macklemore mac miller and asher roth
and have some back and forths
and record a wack response to kendrick lamar's control verse
and perform fack in concert
yo i put that shit on a greatest hits album
now that was awesome
it takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
sometimes i have to ponder why people are like
and put up with my crap so long for
what's the attraction mama
is it the fact that i'm a walking talking actual quadruple entendre
or the pointy nose that's pointing at you mama
who knows at this point it's always poking so meh
still get along with this voice cause that's the monster
so do - si - do with a sociopath everyone who knows me knows that
what they don't know is the fact rihanna calls me pinocchio meh

and i'm a spectacular archer feed count dracula chocula
godzilla half dragon and bob dylan
bandwagoners i'm kicking the damn stragglers off and i'm strangling 'em
smack kim basinger on a ass
i guess you could consider it poetry but with me it started out with just words just words
they started looking like puzzle pieces so i started connecting them to each other 'til they started to resemble blank canvases
by this time i was an artist so i just started to see these pictures these real visuals psychopathical killer
feeling it in the air hanging in the night
staring at the full moon
did you ever think we would come to find
maybe in my dreams
i'm a psychopath i'm never keeping it plain
lyrical murder is something i've been about
ever since i was a little kid doodling in the class
drew a picture of my teacher bullet in his head ruler in his ass
with a toilet in front of him throwing up pissed off
prolly symbolic of this thought sick tot
to my inner enemy in a rush
i'm having nightmares of leaving behind my dreams
with anything less than a full bank
it's like i'm general hong and i'm standing in front of a gun
i'm putting myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank
the hood is over my eyes but the wool aingt
yeah got the mentality of being with a wizard
every award show we don't even get considered
how do you sell something that's so lyrical
to a kid that wouldn't know what was hitting if it hit him
now i wanna talk about these niggas from detroit
before me and shady who was thinking 'bout detroit
we put the world onto us so watch how you say fuck me
you just might jinx yourself whoop your girl gon' do it
cause i was in 911 in chicago 911 at the same time
i had already been grinding since '97 that's longevity
and if you think you're lyrically better you better be a killer
you aingt ever see a mothafucka get realer
pull an automatic on anybody sporadic i choose
cause aingt nobody iller
knowing nobody for realer
this elite drinker is a ringleader
i'm a deep thinker i'm a street preacher
with a street sweeper full of heat seekers
in your jeep speakers i'm a keep ringers
i don't need heaters i got the meat cleaver
welcome to the slaughterhouse
niggas try to tell me i spell too much
capital s to the laugh to the t - e - r
ho u - s - e now go to hell you fucks word
making work disappear quick as magic
abracadabra the traffic blacker than africa
can you imagine a nigga flipping bread for the blood
money like dracula has him a spatula ask me a question
am i the best with the flexing
fuck yes with the goon talk
i just moonwalk all over the beat then i'm lighting up the street
crooked going michael jackson on thriller
i'm a psychopath i'm a killer
the thought of retiring
is making me want to set your daughter on fire with a soldering iron
what up mom applying for the rim job are you hiring
i'm hoping to fill up your opening
oh but i know i gotta meet a lot of requirements
first i gotta accept you in the lobby and the isle and
you've probably already been with all the slaughter and iron men
no mood to be playing second fiddle slob on this violin
with no strings attached
i'm just the product of a hostile environment
but being brought up so brought up inspired
but i don't know why it's still like i'm caught up inside a whirlpool
not an appliance but applying this science i psychotically rhyme
and it's like stars have aligned all in alliance
heart of a lion balls of goliath
obscene talking the twine like a bean's talking and buying
but i keep walking the line between the wrong and the right
but everything i write seems wrong and it's like
i'm ecstatic at all the static that i can still cause
in the fabric of our modern society
now catholics are panicking cause i snapped back to my old antics and shenanigans
dammit the pope's mad again
probably shouldn't have ran up in the vatican with that mannequin
singing bagpipes from baghdad again
in my dad's drag dragging a faggot in a glad bag
won't be the last time i make a dramatic entrance like that again
you thought i was lying when i said i think that i'm crossing the line again
i've lost my mind caution oh god i think i've thought of another fucking line
forgive me father for i have sinned
but hip hop has left me brainwashed with a violent streak
defiant now the odds of me trying to fucking be quiet
probably gotta be 'bout as high as the jolly green giant
after he's fallen in pollen next to a killer bee hive colony trying to sneak by it
while his feet stomp follow me while i revive rap
i'm a start up a rioting try to stop it or silence it
you're not gonna might as well just hit the block in your jogging attire in
boston across the marathon finish line and i
put your thoughts against mine
cause the arsenal i have'll scar you for life worse than dzhokhar
and i have a bomb pliers and barbed wire
your bars are like barney fife with a fucking swiss army knife
a saberless darth vader with arthritis at a bar fight
with the dark knight on a dark night with his arms tied up
i'm dahmer - like when i'm on the mic i'm not gonna lie
perform like i'm gonna die at the end of a song so it's hard for the rhyme to end
like fuck 'em all and just ride
like i'm locked up inside a shot up bonnie and clyde car
uncle ronnie is driving 'bout to burst in through the side door
of arkham asylum and park in the dining room
roll over and go to reach for you you're gone
this bed's empty without you
you said you're moving on
but i'm having some trouble getting there
but dwelling aingt getting me uhh anywhere
fucking valentine's day
fuck february stuffed teddy bear guts everywhere
machete on the floor i smashed up every mirror
yeah how do i look
you fucking just let me here to die didn't you
why didn't you respond yet
i've written you five or six different times and
i'm getting sick and tired of always apolo - gizing to you
i didn't do shit to deserve what you're putting me through
this couldn't be true we can't be over
so violets are blue roses are red
why is it everything i do i'm reminded of you
saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
i saw my lord jesus with his hands pointing toward the light
saw my old sweetheart she said honey i'm back
just so you don't die alone just so you don't die alone
guess i gotta deal with the fact that you aingt never coming back
now every woman that i look at i'm looking for you
so i'm finding something the matter with them
excuse to not see anyone
useless rather pick up the phone not at all following protocol
i get bowled like bowling balls
no balls and go to call to talk forget what i want to say
damnit i'm drawing blanks like i'm playing hangman
i'm sick of playing these games i can't handle this heartbreak
it's making me wanna blow out my brains
like birthday cake candles
hang up the phone and i shake i think i may have made a mistake
can't escape the madness
turn the radio on i hate this sad song
but i can't even change the station
the same one's playing on eight channels
i lay awake in shambles i'm startin to hallucinate
i'm having all these visions of us at each other's wakes
in caskets and suddenly i wake and that's when i know i
give me one more bottle for the pain
give me one more for the memories
give me one more i'll make it taste like a steak
it'll help alleviate
it'll soothe this ache
of trying to fake
that she's really she's really coming back
and it's been a while now but i finally realize how
much reality sucks but it's just something about our love
i'm still in denial now dealing with the finality of it
and it's making me crazy thinking of the days we spent
and how i'll never hold you again
aingt shit i can do about it
now my head is overcrowded
with these clouded memories and i can't seem to get you out it
and how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
knowing what you done did to me huh
did it even occur to you that i loved you
completely deep and madly head over heels for you
was you and me once used to be together forever
it was supposed to be us but you crushed the dream
we was supposed to die together and it's killing me so much
when i sleep i wake up dead must be why i
got a shitty grin bitch show me them itty - bitty titties again
we're in sin city since when did we begin to get addicted to dope
diggity bitch you need to run and go get your friggidy - friends
i'm looking at your bum - stickidy - bum hun
the migidy mac's bigidy back

got a 6 o' clock craving stop get ciroc
it's about to be an unbelievable night
i call it surreal sir mix a lot tape in
hit the spot spot my next victim up
picky like i missed a spot shaving
came to sip vodka shit yeah that little chick is hot but if she got rabies
i wouldn't give the bitch a shot i poke her in the rear
but i bet if i lick her she'll try to chase me

if not then trick piss off you snobby little pig snot nose
you think you're hot shit cause you're in heat
well bitch if you're solar
then i'm your polar opposite dog cause i'm colder than popsicle sticks popping shit

then my sick thoughts are about to lick shots
like this shit's hopping and drip - dropping in chocolate - ly whip - topping
so whether you're hip hop slipknot big pac
kid rock kris kross rick ross you'll dig this
if not then kick rocks in flip flops
and i produced the track
so you don't have to ask who it is when this shit knocks 
so bring clairvoyance to this bangin and i'm a keep on saying
all the shit i should be hung for and probably killed for saying
and i probably will but not until the day i pop a pill again
like chopping 'til i'm dropping still if that don't do the job of killing shady then the karma will insane him
i'm as brainy mohammad until the parkinson's done eat away my brain
and made me robin williams crazy
or i end up with dementia but you rocking with a sadist
so you can say this but if the thought is entertaining
i aingt stopping to explain it
oh my god for real man not again i'm shaking
but before i tie a rope around this nob
if they don't like it got a knob they can slob on until it's - 
wait i just forgot what i was thinking

something about the balls between my legs and i think i can feel it dangling it's throbbing and it's veiny
wait i think i got it okay bitch i got you robin williams hanging
let's go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
come on kemosabe

cause if the way that i spit shit remains on my dick then she grab me by the nuts and tried to take my sausage as a hostage

that she's plain addicted to my dick like lorena bobbit
got a wean her off it weiner off it like she took my fucking penis chopped it and stuck it up between her armpits
and she begun to swing a crumpet knife and paint the carpet at least that's what her train of thought is
cause i came saw conquered hit it quit it and made up a plane of bonkers
and i always end up giving these bitches some complex
and i don't mean apartment
so spread your feet apart
and let me see you do some yoga stretches splits

and that's just to get in this bedroom bitch

'till we get to las vegas

so let's go all the way dear
til we get to las vegas
whatever happens in my room it stays in my room like movie night like cable
treat every women in my stable like flavors
looking like she kryptonite and i get weak after like 7 days
in 7 nights in the days inn it's our vegas
we roll in circles in packs we the lifesavers
she got a boyfriend i got a toy then
i'll bring her with me when i show up to her crib waving
and i aingt tryna be the nice neighbor
i'm so jay electronic i'm cut like i'm all out of razors
and all i got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
next ho froze and it look like i walked in to a jewelry store
with a about a million dollars with your mama
and sat down n did the als challenge haaaan
i stole that adlib from french bad & evil back at it again
about to get my back tatted again
about to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
sitting on a bike in the sand
if you aingt been through nothing
then that shouldn't mean nothing to you like lice on a gram
if she current i keep her pussy purring like the pipes on a lam
weed got her so chinky eyed
look like she been getting high on a flight to japan
i keep my jewelry on while i'm fucking
sound like i'm shaking up dice in a can
listen though this aingt christmas i make you my ex miss
if this is my passion
i learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence
the gift of my absence
i don't know who you been listening to
got me fucked up like pookie in the chicken coop
bitch i don't give a two shits
bitch get the fuck out of my face
to make a long story short i don't really gotta stand there
and listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
even though i have an affinity for witty banter
starting to feel like foulplay like billy laimbeer
hold up she misunderstood me
i said take parvour four
thought i said the wraith had four doors
i knock a nigga face off
give him the bottom of the nine like a baseball scoreboard 
i leave the club with my tab still open
won't even get a cab for you and your friend
the only fear i have is of loathing
and i won't even kick in 'till we get to las vegas
yo yo yo

man jump off joe beezy

i seen a lot of come i seen a lot of go
but y'all know where i'm from b - r double o
you know the rest pimping yeah i was bred different
here come pops with the ny bop you know the leg limping
my ice mug frozen till it's stiff
grimy nigga might wanna hold onto your bitch
i got a way with women i faithfully play with women
let 'em suck on this bottle and pray that i throw a baby in 'em
i might just throw 'em a gold fronts
pour up a cup of e & j and light up a dro blunt
i was never soft never saw me flinching when they letting off
never had to retaliate cause i set it off
ya'll know my name bitch never change up my language
i'm just a rich nigga from a city that's bankrupt
first we take oath
then i'm pulling turquoise strings in my lebron corks in turks and caicos
i came from wicked chair fame wearing short sets
i learned that money can't buy happiness
but i decided i'd rather do all my crying in the corvette
make a dollar buy a suit
have a child and have 'em follow suit
waving that weatherchange things
make the winter fall coming through with everything to lose
taking everything from you know
let him finish his fall in his draws
and pray that he land on that minute hand in my hublot
i'm about that art of war gospel
that basquiat picasso drawing a roscoe
using the blood of a usual thug who was told die slow
your money on me bet it all you know i'mma set it off
let's skip the small talk and get right to the wealth
truth is i give a fuck but it's right to myself
fuck fame keep the shit i write to myself
if what i do is therapeutic man the slightest shit helps
made angel dust my freshman year
gave it a try cool little did i knew
had the wrong meaning of high school
teachers called him a sociopath and a liar
fuck them only went to class for the cyphers
now i'm getting bills for
the same thinking they tried to prescribe pills for
they said i needed a wrench i'm a loose screw
vital suicidal said i would kill mi amour
wasn't speaking in french said i'd let it off
never know who or what you might get
main reason they never want me to set it off
you now dealing with four niggas that's never off
all bets off so nah you won't be better off
jewish tats arm on my arm like a semitic boss
egyptian art hanging uh that's my kemetic cross
slaughterhouse set it off
even got bitches waving our flag betsy ross
old school chevy the head is off
decapitated impala
heavy lack from the weight of the llama
still bear arms like a shaven koala
how you thinking like a faded neurology student
is prudent when chasing a dollar
so never mind a clever rhyme
i'd rather find a better grind forever times
sitting behind me because i'm ahead of mine
in this era i'm living outside of the paradigm
i'm coming outside with a pair of dimes
sharon and caroline
share a line then they share a 9 inch never mind
i probably shouldn't even keep going
cause these rappers keep hoeing with their teeth showing
i set it off
feels like a close it's coming to
fuck am i gonna do
it's too late to start over
this is the only thing i thing i know
sometimes i feel like all i ever do is
find different ways to word the same old song
ever since i came a long
from the day the song called hi my name is dropped
started thinking my name was fault
cause any time things went wrong
i was the one who they would blame it on
the media made me the equivalent of a modern - day genghis khan
tried to argue it was only entertainment dog
gangsta nah courageous balls
had to change my style they said i'm way too soft
and i sound like az & nas out came the claws
and the fangs been out since then
but up until the instant that i went against it
it was ingrained in me that i wouldn't amount to a shitstain i thought
no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
do i really belong in this game i pondered
i just wanna' play my part should i make waves or not
so back and forth in my brain the tug - o - war wages on
i don't wanna' seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform i was raised upon
but sometimes you gotta' take a loss
and have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
keep plugging it's your only outlet
and your only outfit so you know they're gonna' talk about it
better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
feel like i've already said this a kabillion eighty times
how many times can i say the same thing different ways that rhyme
what i really wanna' say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story
bet 'cha feel the same way i felt when i was in the same place you are
when i was afraid ta'
i was a afraid to make a single sound
afraid i would never find a way out
afraid i'd never be found
i don't wanna' go another round
an angry man's power will shut you up
trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
run out of excuses for everyone
so here i am and i will not run
guts over fear 
for all the times i let you push me round
and let you keep me down
now i got guts over fear guts over fear
i know what it's like i was there once single parents
hate your appearance did you struggle to find your place in this world
and the pain spawns all the anger on
but it wasn't until i put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
that i made a spark started to spit hard as shit
learned how to harness it while the reins were off
and there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
was soon as i stopped saying i gave a fuck
haters started to appreciate my art
and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain i've caused
but what am i gonna do when the rage is gone
and the lights go out in that trailer park
and the window is closing and there's nowhere else that i can go with flows
and i'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
just a bunch of playful songs that i make for fun
so to the break of dawn here i go recycling the same old song
but i'd rather make not afraid 2 than make another motherfucking we made you uh
and i don't wanna' seem indulgent when i discuss my lows and my highs
my demise and my uprise pray to god
i just opened enough eyes later on
gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use that'll make ya' strong
enough to lift yourself up when you feel like i felt
'cause i can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
just having to balance my dang self
when on eggshells i was made to walk
but thank you ma 'cause that gave me the
strength to cause shady - mania
so when they empty that stadium
'least i made it out ta that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
so this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
i represent him or her anyone similar you are the reason that i made this song
and everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
from this day forward just let them a - holes talk
take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
the legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when i'm gone
and to think i was a
afraid i would never find a way o - o - out
i don't wanna go another round
these donuts are delicious son of a bitch
we got a 10 - 94 on hines road requesting backup
repeat 10 - 94 on hines road heading southbound i'm in pursuit
pick up pick up daddy's in the pickup

dressed in a tin man suit

cause cops pull us over just to fucking meet us
cause marshall's a rap god damn right
well then i guess that makes me jesus
so turn this water to whiskey
watch the dirty south go from dirty to filthy
high class only means stoned in school
joints rolled up bigger than pony stool
smoke stains on the roof of the old regal's brown
so what i got spokes on this bitch and
the lift kicks like climbing into a spaceship
ufo's unidentified flying oldsmobiles
and mobile homes amen
i can still smell the kerosene leaking
i should've seen the signs i was blowing up
either in a trailer home or a pickup
hey bubba your baby boy is in big trouble
i fucking ran through a briar patch and got cut up
now i'm wide open in front of the whole town
i bled for the game i guess it's obvious now
i'm going down now he told me wear it with pride
you wanna take the hard road you gotta cherish the ride
most mothafuckers won't jump to embarrass the fly
can't build a legacy up then let it perish and die
uh i feel no pain
uh i've got my mask on
uh i'm numb to the world
the devil out to get me moving pretty fast
head on collision i'm tryna avoid the crash  -  
i'm running from my past  -  
that's why i wear the mask
these blood sucking leeches all they want is the cash
you don't get the picture it could be gone in a flash  -  
hope you bought a package of kleenex 
package the rejects 
actually its a fact that we shack in the p - jects
naturally a rat pack will attack cheese 
thats why im in yellow and green
may i tap trap all these 
no i dont trust these hoes nigga 
say they love you for you then turn into gold digger 
what the fuck you ask me for a dollar for
shooting the gym i aint balling ho
what i look like any baller you know 
yup shots fired calling it kettle
black shit turned the pot higher
eyes tired
keep trying to sell me a smile but im a hard buyer
keep shit moving like a car tire
what you want a necklace
ill make you a chain out some barbed wire
i got his earth on my shoulders real life for rapping
if you threw the planet at me id headbutt it and crack it
on another tax bracket and i been cleaning my house
but my old habits are in the attic ill pull 'em out
and keep reminding y'all you aint got it all
devil keep pulling me by the drawers
not at all amazed at these haters
youve seen my catalog
speaking and we keep flying over 'em like a cannonball
think im this comical swag follower
just rhyming over beats
while these leakers sucking all of us off 
still got your mama covered in vomit in my cellphone
y'all really got me fucked up
what you mixing up in that cup
what the hell you sprinkle in that blunt
44 make him sober up
i got an addiction to all these prescriptions
need an intervention someone to listen
catholic or christian fuck your suspicions
turn it up 
i be blowing on half a pound
pass it around and pass it around
merry go - round merry go - round
she say she love me but this bitch is ugly
i'mma still let her fuck me
they say the devil is a liar
nigga don't worry 'bout that loud mouth
bumping his gums and babbling
watch for them quiet niggas
on the real you should come ride with us
crew full of riders; optimus
my back seems like you got your facts all crossed up no swastikas
fading in and out of my consciousness
tryna fight this feeling im conjuring
that's why i wear a hat so low with a mask
really feeling like the lochness
no bullshit these bitches are more grimy
doing a nigga real slimey
had my little homie stretched out death untimely
need i remind me hold up
yo dont get doped up
heard rumors that niggas wanna clap at me
well actually i was just over there
niggas aint really do jack to me
thats why i keep this mask on straight face
only thing thats missing is my  get my runyon ave soldiers
another day another hotel the inside of it's nice though
oh well this is my life so
as i go and try to close for the night's show
see how far that line goes
still blows my mind show
business guess i'll just never get
so this shit just always feels so weird
to this day because all i ever did
was just say the shit i wouldve wanted to hear
other people say to me when i was a kid
so please don't make me some type of hero
cause i will say some inspirational shit in a real way
but still will have a field day with some of the
fucked up shit in the world and tell it to suck the dick
cause i still make fun of a sit
someone's in like a son of a bitch
at another's expense i'm fucking relentless
as fuck when it comes to this pen
i struggle with coming to my senses
stuck on the fence on a balance beam if i seem unbalanced
it's challenging but my conscience allows me to think
the most foulish childish things without even blinking
without even thinking about all the stinking amounts of people that seem to be reaching in the crowds
i'm scream in the palace sold out this evening
but now it's lay me down to sleeping
is it really my soul to keep or
have i sold it cheap is it greed
do i take more than i need
when i joke about leaving
but keep over achieving
because what's stolen from me barely broke even
it's a fine fine line
so i notice how i paint myself
and through my hair when ordeals i'm so vain
i want my respect but ignore the
butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
till i sit in the dark and i reflect
and my reflection shows what it's like here
cause this vanity surrounded by all these lights yeah
it's like a nightmare
i said this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare
and i don't like how i see myself so i
open the bible to isaiah cause
i swear to christ there are nights where
i stay up at night just to say a prayer twice
just to make sure god hears cause this ice layer
ice skate on the nice way
puting it but i like staying
feistier then a triceritops and like a dice player
i got a nice pair of dice here
sealed off in my lair
away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit
from in this house it's quite bare but it aingt when you can't leave it
and i feel so isolated nice i made it
but it's like i payed the price of fame twice i hate it
so i bitch about my life then make another song it's a cycle aingt it
then i wonder why i stay famous
keep walking the line
this gold fish poke gets old
but especially when you don't know
if your conscience is saying i told you so
you don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier
or if you sold your soul
and from here you look so small
hovering high above us all
please come back to me
i still remember the times when
they were simpler than the rhymes of
vanilla ice were when i was just killing the mics
i'll never forget what that feeling was like i
miss those times now when i was just starting out
without a dime and now i'm diamond
can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when i've been
stuck in this house hibernating
hate even going outside it
sucks sometimes i just wanna walk in target and look at shit browse i don't even want to buy nothing
i just wanna fucking walk around inside it
look how excited i sound when i get to talking bout life and
everything about it i miss
which now reminds me
put a thousand lighters in the sky for the outsidaz
wow i must have had alzheimers
long time since i shouted them out bout time
cause it's been on my mind lately how
zee you always supported me
you vouched i will never forget that and
how you guys accepted me for me and pace
i love you too you slept on my couch
and i been thinking bout the time i slept on the floor at the outhouse
rhyming is all we ever wanted to do
and regardless how life has turned out
inside i'll always be an outsider
my life has been turned inside out but i
you sit there stone - faced as if i'm not here
can't you see that i've been crying
i didn't know you'd be insane
dreams can be so deceiving
you're an itch i can't reach
a wound that won't heal
the smell of skin that's burning
but it's true and just say all i am to you is a
pain in my neck thorn in my side
stain on my blade blood on my knife
been dreaming of her all of my life
but she won't come true she's just my nightmare i woke up to
she's twisted he's a rebel she's sick he's hard to handle
the worst of all is he just don't care
she's twisted like a rope that is wrapped around her throat
but the worst part of all is she really don't give a 
sometimes i wish that you'd just die
cause i'm too afraid of leaving
i didn't know you feel the same
when i say you're no good
all you are to me
is a pain in my neck thorn in my side
love aingt no fairytale love is a buried nail
inside of this heart of stone so you wanna get married
well romeo romeo smoking blow with antonio
in the back alley taking shots of whiskey and only gold
juliet's at the nudie bar doing god only knows
neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show
but a bitch is a bitch and a horse is a horse aingt it
sorry i can't afford to get your daddy's old porsche painted
sorry juliet that you embedded the saying
if a dollar makes you holler well then i'm getting the short change of it
feel like i've been asleeping alone and loving this angel
entangled between a dream and a coma
walking the edge of this cliff like a sheep to it's owner
then woke up to this fucking bitch with an evil persona
now if you say that you hate somebody and you living with them
then they pack up and leave and then you bitch about how you miss 'em
you gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steering wheel
love is a cannibal riding a carnival carousel
'round and 'round we roll where it stops baby nobody knows
some people go crazy and they lose control
some people jump off some people won't let go
some people say love some people say why
some people don't love they just want a free ride
the rain won't stop it'll never dry
if she's in the house of pain then love is standing outside
maybe i'm the twisted one that screwed this up
so i guess this means goodbye for now
i feel phenomenal as usual
pharmaceuticals glue stick to crucify me at bonnaroo
but i don't know if i'm in tennessee chicago or houston
in the corner trying to seek solitude
shallow but such a hollow dude
i won't even swallow solid food
alcoholic too plus i'm on lean like the tower of pisa
top it off i'm on mushrooms so fuck all of you
roses to violet mollies are blue
lost in a ball of confusion
its all an illusion
it's probably the shrooms i'm on
cause i think i started hallucinating
cause i just thought i just heard jay electronica and odd future's new shit
and all i can do is follow the music
and end up with paula abdul at lollapalooza
filling water balloons with nail polish remover
just a problem in wallowing fumes
i feel uptight i gotta get looser
after i finish polishing off this bottle of booze i got a solution
concentrated like orange juice so i'm not as diluted
cause all this delusion got me seeing shit
excusez - moi but that coochie that passed
you see her ass wouldn't make her my main squeeze
but juicier ass it belongs in a juicer
it's mouth watering too so i walked up to it like i'm marshall
wanna try to meet my standards i'll introduce ya
oh i'm a misogynist too but i'm not a masseuse
but my attitude is rubbing off on the youth
a chronic abuser not only user of marijuana
i mean verbal assault that i use to smoke all of you losers
got a bazooka a shotgun a ruger a glock and a nuke
and a rottweiler too i'm not in the mood so
when i say i'm bringing the tec out
i'm not coming to repair your fucking electronic computers
god i'm gonna puke
i'm so gone off the hookah
i think i swallowed a loofah
i'm tore up demolished a fucking stone like oliver
like i looked medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
the thoughts i produce are loony tunes
the box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes
to replace next up veronica's boobs
and a paychecks that were stuffed in a glove box
in a blue honda with used condoms were clues
the girl was just not the one suitable for him
right for me will change me rearrange my head to be
just right for you and me dont laugh please listen
dont laugh please listen
thought i could endure the pressure
collapse and crumble perhaps
relapsing under that
well that's a bunch of crap
in the clutch i'm the captain crunch of rap
and i'm sick of acting humble thats enough of that
fuck that shit cut the sack
like its a natural reaction
that's why i'm actually trapped in this shoving match
cause push keeps coming to that
i can keep getting my ass kicked keep it coming back
like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit so mad
disgruntled had some struggles yeah
but that passionate hunger's back
the fantastic juggling act
and the way i flip my tongue on the track
it's like verbal acrobatics
but in fact
last time i tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
i fucking crashed my hovercraft
after i strapped the duffel bag to my back
and stuck the massive punching bag in it
an elastic bungee strap proper plaster a thumb tack
and a piece of plastic bubble wrap
went spastic and fucking snapped
jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid
stumbled back recovered back flipped
and landed on a gymnastic tumble mat
and for my last trick lunge on back lash
on a nasa shuttle flap fucking snapped the rudder in half
chuckled and laughed buttaled my last rebuttal
and just asked him to come crash
and i go grab my go - go - gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress
and ceramic construction hat
rubbed my magic mushroom tat
fell off then splat get up from that
face taped to a waste paper basket
throw up then gas lungs collapse
and that's more likely than finding someone that's
couple of shots of jager
public intoxication dis - fucking - combobulation
flooded with thoughts of anger
while i was away i know probably some of you got to thinking
you're top ten aingt cha stop cause you fuckers are talking crazy
and stop interrupting you're not even up in the conversation
whether you're punching a clock or famous
underground pop or nameless whatever your job is
i came to fuck with your occupation
you're thinking just cause you came in with scrubs
and you brought the scalpel and sponge
the oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon
stuck in the operating room
once you done swapped your name with him
smuggled in ronald reagan
if you duck him up donald fagen
while juggling waffles baking
fucking mcdonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle
they flung it across the table
then bump it and knock it shake it
jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration
i said fuck it and lost my patience
since they all woke up from sedation
aingt none of you doctor dre
so then what does it got you thinking
that you can fuck with this operation
aftermath still running hip - hop amazing
i'm still plugging along
no need for an assumption
here's confirmation
i'm up for the long duration
i'm just looking for something to walk away with
some pocket change and a little integrity
though i'll probably be jumping across the stage
till i'm fucking madonna's age and
stuck in an awkward place in my life
but i shit you not like i'm fucked up with constipation
that day will come before i stumble upon some ladies
yo if you could just for one minute
or one split second in time forget everything
everything that bothers you all your problems
everything and follow me
if i was frozen inside of a moment
if i could capture time inside a capsule
an hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand it passes through it
if i can grasp it and just control what happens to it
then i can trap it so no more time elapses through it
if raps could do it maybe i could tap into it
then i could try to channel it through cadillacs and buicks
to transmit through 'em to make you put your ass into it
and that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it
your passions too much for you to not be dancing to it
and as you do it your movements become fast and fluent
you're mashing to it moshing until you're black and bluish
you're acting foolish this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion
true it's chaotic but it's got your body moving as a unit
uniting together tonight so make it last and you better just
lose yourself in this music
this moment we own it we won't never let it go 
you better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
there is no time to sit there and procrastinate 
cause when we descend together we begin to move as one
in perfect unison just like the moon and sun
illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
rhythmically in sync if you'll excuse the pun
but if you could lose it once i mean if you could let shit go
relax take a breath and just let it exit slow
to rest your soul you could leave the rest to me
if i could give the world a hit of ecstasy
to make 'em feel the feeling that i'm feeling right this minute
cause i feel like the night won't end til i get finished
so close the shades making sure no light gets in it
the sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite
a high percentage of black people and white mixed in it
but no one really gives a fuck cause they just like what's spinning
his life was spinning the whole entire night just spinning
like life's beginning so come out from inside your skin and quit hiding in it
ryan's a homocidal misfit

patrolling corners
looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
i'm meaner in action
than rosco beating james tarteenyer 
and smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
i grew up in the wild hood
as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood
that i used as an excuse
and aint shit changed
but kept the same mindstate
since the third time that i failed 9th grade
you probably think that i'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
i don't promote violence i just encourage it
i laugh at the sight of death
as i fall down a cement flight of steps
and land inside a bed of spider webs
so throw caution to the wind
you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again
shit why not blow your brain out
i'm blowing mine out
fuck it you only live once you might as well die now
it's only fair to warn
i was born with a set of horns
and metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord
warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board
that smashed into your honda accord
with a 4 door ford
but i'm more toward droppin an accapella
and chopping a fella
to mozarella
worse than a hellacopta propella
got you locked in the cella
with your skeleton showing
developing anorexia
while i'm standin next to ya
eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
with an iv in your veins
feeding you liquid darvicet
pumping you full of drugs
pull the plugs
on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
who were picked up in an ambulance
and driven
to receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants
and given
a less than 20 percent chance
of living
have a possible placement
it's a hospital patient
storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
doctor kevorkian has arrived
to perform an autopsy on you while you scream i'm still alive
driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
and pulling your adams apple out through your mouth
better call the fire department
i've hired a arson
to set fire to carpet
and burn up your entire apartment
i'm a liar to start shit 
got your bitch wrapped around my dick
so tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit
met a retarded kid named greg with a wooden leg
snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40
mixed up with alka seltzer and formula 44d
fuck an acid tab i'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead

i'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion
leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas

we blowin up your house killing your parents 
and coming back to get your foster mommas
and i'm as good at keeping a promise as nostradamus
cause i aint making no more threats
i'm doing drivebys in tinted corvettes on vietnam war vets
i'm more or less sick in the head
maybe more cause i smoked crack  
today yesterday and the day before sabbath
walk the block with a labrador
strapit more corral for war than el salvador
foul style galore
verbal cow manure
coming together like the eyebrow on al b sure
you probably gonna think that i'm talking about you and you goddamn right i am
look at you this is the minimal i could diss you
subliminally but i think criminal instinct
has pushed me to the brink my pussy does it stink
he still loves me cause he puts me in his ink
he does doesn't he still is isn't he
nah i'm just playing tug of war with his heart cause he misses me
i can still fuck him and leave him whenever i feel frisky
and there's no risk of disease cause he aingt with anyone is he
this bitch really thinks she can get me
if she still wants me driving across country
strapped him to the front seat missing all the front teeth
thinking to herself when's the next time he's gonna punch me
i told this cunt she's gonna over - do it once
and once she does she'll  be stuffed up in a trunk
crunch he scrunched her up in a ball
bunched up nice and comfy
fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me
you cunning little cunt deceitful witch
you thought you had me 'till my shrink told me this
the problem is all inside your head she said to me
the answer is easy if you take it logically
i'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
there must be 50 ways to leave your lover
i feel like a serial killer
i keep dumping bodies in the lake imma get caught and sent up the river
i shiver when i think of the company i keep
how do i know she aingt gonna kill me when i sleep
i shriek every time she hands me something to drink
sex kept us together when we slept together everything
was all better she made me feel like a king
slowly she began lowering my self - esteem
she go to the club and not answer the phone when i call her
and i just bought her a truck for 50000 dollars
accused me of doing drugs and screaming holla
then i find a bag of coke on her some marijuana
and all i know is every time i go
to them hiding spots wherever she hides her blow
the little bags of dope there was a pile of coke
that's growing smaller and that was just a while ago
and i wouldn't even let on like i know
what was i supposed to do call her out on it we just argue
say she put it down on purpose and flipped the whole script
ooh she's a manipulative evil bitch
a cunning little cunt little deceitful witch
she thought she had me 'till my shrink told me this
it's alright it's ok i'm gonna make it anyway
i'ma make it i'ma make it i'ma make it somehow
sometimes i just feel like quitting i still might
why do i put up this fight why do i still write
sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life
sometimes i wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
and show these people what my level of skill's like
but i'm still white sometimes i just hate life
something aingt right hit the brake lights
case of the stage fright drawing a blank like
da - duh - duh - da - da it aingt my fault
breaking eye balls my insides crawl
and i clam up  i just slam shut
i just can't do it my whole manhood's
just been stripped i have just been vicked
so i must then get off the bus then split
man fuck this shit yo i'm going the fuck home
world on my shoulders as i run back to this 8 mile road
i'm a man i'ma make a new plan
time for me to just stand up and travel new land
time for me to just take matters into my own hands
once i'm over these tracks man i'ma never look back
 and i'm gone i know right where i'm going
sorry momma i'm grown i must travel alone
aingt gon' follow the footsteps i'm making my own
only way that i know how to escape from this 8 mile road
i'm walking these train tracks trying to regain back
the spirit i had 'fore i go back to the same crap
to the same plant and the same pants
trying to chase rap gotta move asap
and get a new plan momma's got a new man
poor little baby sister she don't understand
sits in front of the tv buries her nose in the pad
and just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
while she colors her big brother and mother and dad
aingt no telling what really goes on in her little head
wish i could be the daddy that neither one of us had
but i keep running from something i never wanted so bad
sometimes i get upset cause i aingt blew up yet
it's like i grew up but i aingt grow me two nuts yet
don't gotta rep my step don't got enough pep
the pressure's too much man i'm just trying to do what's best
and i try sit alone and i cry
yo i won't tell no lie not a moment goes by
that i don't pray to the sky please i'm begging you god
please don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job
yo i hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
yo i'm telling you dawg i'm balling this trailer tomorrow
tell my mother i love her kiss baby sister goodbye
say whenever you need me baby i'm never too far
but yo i gotta get out there the only way i know
and i'ma be back for you the second that i blow
on everything i own i'll make it on my own
off to work i go back to this 8 mile road
you gotta live it to feel it you didn't you wouldn't get it
or see what the big deal is why it wasn't the skillest
to be walking this borderline of detroit city limits
it's different it's a certain significance
a certificate of authenticity you'd never even see
but it's everything to me it's my credibility
you never seen heard smelled or met a real mc
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
but yet i'm still unsigned having a rough time
sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
go to work and serve mc's in the lunchline
but when it comes crunch time where do my punchlines go
who must i show to bust my flow
where must i go who must i know
or am i just another crab in the bucket
cause i aingt having no luck with this little rabbit's foot fuck it
maybe i need a new outlet i'm starting to doubt shit
i'm feeling a little skeptical who i hang out with
i look like a bum yo my clothes aingt about shit
at the salvation army trying to salvage an outfit
and it's cold trying to travel this road
plus i feel like i'm on stuck in this battling mode
my defenses are so up but one thing i don't want
is pity from no one the city is no fun
there is no sun and it's so dark
sometimes i feel like i'm just being pulled apart
from each one of my limbs by each one of my friends
it's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
sometimes i feel like a robot sometimes i just know not
what i'm doing i just blow my head is a stove top
i just explode the kettle gets so hot
sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid i don't got
but i've learned it's time for me to u - turn
yo it only takes one time for me to get burned

just to take you back to last summer man
you don't remember when you was my sweetest
you don't remember when i called you reese's pieces
cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
she turned around and giggle said; you so nuts
but nowadays we acting way too grown up
like how ya ex girl get the new numba
the rumors was so numerous
for sticking by me i had to give you two thumbs up
it's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather
so young so full of life and vibrant
side by side wherever you was riding i went
so close almost was some bonnie and clyde shit
when ronnie died you was right by my side
with a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes
and a bucket to catch every tear i cried inside it
you even had the same type of childhood i did
sometimes i just wanna know why
is it that you surcame to yours
and mine i survived it
you ran the streets i nine to fived it
we grew up grew apart as time went by us
then i blew up to both yours and mine surprises
now i feel the vibe i just cant describe it
much as your pride tries to hide it
you're cold your touch its like ice
and your eyes is the look of resentment
i can sense it and i don't like it
uh stuck alone in this wave race
say i'm living too fast don't plan on changing my pace
got one foot on the gas it's never a need for brakes
smoke ez - rider's with hash fuck bitches from out of state
valet bringing my cars waiter bringing me plates
shrimp and fillet mignon we celebrate buying drinks
wit a couple of broads my nigga's who got love for me
it's lonely at the top i'm tired of having company
uh so while you busy trying to fit in i'm a stand out
and view my life through this lens to see how it pan's out
substitute teacher ass nigga's need a handout
middle finger screaming fuck them nigga's who hated

pop another bottle that chronic smokin degraded
speculating me landing must of got me mistaken
i'm speaking as the captain of the planes

i go bezerker than a fed - up post - office worker
a merk her with a mossberg
for a gangster you shoulda shit your pants

to make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like burn choyder
you're the eminem backwards you're mini - me
see he's in a whole nother weight class
he smokes your bb's you beat back bullets

i laced the weed with insect repellent better check the smelly
eminem starts with e better check the spelling
with a capital somebody grab me a snapple
i got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple 
somebody dropped me on my head and i was sure
that my mother did it but the bitch won't admit it was her
i slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
and said i'm ready now bitch  -  aingt you feelin these kicks cunt
the world aingt ready for me yet i can tell
i'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
i'm sicker than sperm cells with syphillis germs
and i'm hotter than my dick is when i piss and it burns
i kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it 
 hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet

and all that gibberish you was spittin you need to kill it
cause your style is like dyin in my sleep i don't feel it
cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin

to save me with in case i get chased by space aliens
a brainiac with a cranium packed full of more uranium
than a maniac saudi arabian
a highly combustible head spazmatic
strapped to a kraftmatic adjustable bed
laid up in the hospital in critical condition
i flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician
high speed iv full of thai weed
lookin chinese with my knees stuck together like siamese
twins joined at the groin like lesbians

i hope god forgives me for my sins  -  -  it probably all depends
on if i keep on killin my girlfriends
is fuckin crazy  -  -  listen

last night i od'd on rush mushrooms and dust
and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
 i'm an alcoholic and that's all i can say
i call in to work cause all i do is frolic and play
i swallow grenades and take about a bottle a day
of tylenol 3 and talk about how violent i'll be 
give me eleven excederin my head'll spin
medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine
scratched my balls til i shredded skin

so reach in your billfolds for ten ducats
and pick up this slim shady shit that's on rawkus

the wild gotham
the wild west 
ha ha ride
all you see is the sun reflecting off of the gun
i'm ready for the showdown that go down at one
sweat on my brow let's settle it now
i'm gonna show you how real cowboys get down
i'm polishing gold waiting for this drama to unfold
i got a  rolled
feelin bold gangsters blood runs cold
it's time to reload this old 45 colt
the wind's gusty it's hot muggy and dusty
bust a couple shots make sure i'm not rusty
it's passed noon he should be here soon
sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
all of a sudden i can hear the sound of hoofs
sounds like a thousand wolves
i cock back put the toast in the holster and froze
i pose like a poster he's closer than close
i hold the heat sturdy i heard he fight's dirty
but i'm gonna put thirty inside him and leave early
and just when i went to fill him with hot lead
i put the gun to his head and this is what he said
you never met me and you'll probably never see me again
but i know you  -  the name's slim  -  you want revenge
then don't shoot i'm in the same boots as you
i'm telling the truth i got a price on my head too cause when you
you ride like a cowboy toward the sun
and life aingt fun when you're on the run
got your gold and you got your gun
but life as an outlaw just begun
got your shotgun by your side
got your horse and you got your pride
you ride til there aingt no place to hide
it's sad cause the bad guys always die
he was shady i seen by the look on his face
he said take ten paces  i took eight
spun around and i aimed straight for the brain
my  went bang but it only fired a blank he said
i put a clip in the gun and pointed at his lungs
we both drew at the same time and stood stunned
i figured he was telling the truth that's why i didn't shoot
so what we gonna do it's on you
the chronic
loaded up my saddle got ready for battle
hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
we rolled two miles until we hit the spot
an old ghost town that everybody forgot
a place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
slim grabbed the shotgun 
this is the spot they call him doc loveless
he's going around saying he took the game from us
but he aingt got no legs they cut 'em off at the stomach
he's got mechanical legs he spins webs
plus he's well respected by the hip - hop heads
our mission  -  is to get him to stop laying eggs
and we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
i drew two guns spun them on my fingers
kicked the swinging doors in started gun slinging
i could hear somebody singin  -  it sounded like a g thang
and a verse from keep their heads ringing
i said it's dre's day and started to spray
against 1800 he pulls a ak
hollow tips started flying every which way
that's when i seen dre in trouble and came with the gauge
i fired the first shot spun his body around
he hit the ground and landed upside down
dre grabbed the map the plaques and the gold
i grabbed two girlies and a  that's rolled
always die
people say that i'm a bad influence
i say the world's already fucked i'm just addin to it
they say i'm suicidal teenagers' newest idol 
c'mon do as i do go ahead get mad and do it
hand me an 8 beam me up and land me in space 
i'ma sit on top of the world  and shit on brandy and mase
i'm more than ill
i'm scarier than a white journalist in a room with lauryn hill 
human horror film
but with a lot funnier plot and people that feel me
cause i'ma still be madd rapper whether i got money or not 
as long as i'm on pills and i got plenty of pot
i'll be in a canoe paddlin makin fun of your yacht
but i would like an award 
for the best rapper to get one mic in the source
and a wardrobe i can afford
otherwise i might get sent up back - strike in a ford
and you wonder what the fuck i need more vicadin for
everybody's pissing me off; even the no limit tank 
looks like a middle finger sideways flippin me off
no shit i'm a great danger to my health 
why else would i kill you then jump in the grave and bury myself
i'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless patrollin corners
i'm meaner in action than roscoe beatin james todd sr
across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments 
i grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood that i used as an excuse
and aingt shit changed i kept the same mindstate
i don't promote violence i just encourage it 
as i fall down a cement flight of steps 
so throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
shit why not blow your brain out i'm blowin mine out
my laser disc gon' make you take a razor to your wrist
make you satanistic make you take the pistol to your face 
and place the clip and cock it back
and let it go until your brains are rippin out 
your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
i'm not a role model i don't wanna babysit kids
i got one little girl and hailey jade is shady's business
and shady's just an alias i made to make you pissed off
where the fuck were you when gil was paid to make me dishwash
i make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
you made me get a bigger attitude than eighty kim scott's
and she almost got the same fate that grady's bitch got
i knew that just the two of us would make you hate me this much
and just the two of us that aingt got shit to do with us 
and our personal life it's just words on a mic
so you can call me a punk a pervert or a chauvinist pig
but the funny shit is that i still go with the bitch

oh and your best friend say bye - bye to him
what kinda apple you take a bitea slim

the way that it turned out was nothin like the picture that i painted in my head
sometimes a dream to make it its more fun than it is to actually make it
the game stripped me naked
it robbed me ever having another real relation - 
 - ship with another girl
this world is a fuckin trip
cause i slip in another world proceed take another hit

just to see your name in lights
just so you can live the life

and lose your sight

just cause you got out the hood
concerned only with getting dough
no longer poor but lost your soul they call this

and i can't forsake it

guess i'm addicted
oh well
in my mind i'ma fighter my heart's a lighter
so stop dwelling an i am not felling
you fuckers are not ready cause i got jelly like beyonce's pot belly

this thug life nigga we don't cater to you hoes 
fuck with me have a hundred motherfuckers at yo' do' with fo
other man
i stand in slapped by the wind as i begin
do you know who i am and many reply with a grin
yes i'm tired of being obtruded
why should i be secluded i've got a brand new horn to be tooted
to sum it up in a nutshell eminem will you kick it for me
so i find myself in a certain obligatory
a place that i dwell in fell into some wonderful productions
to make up for lost time and then it brings obstruction
finally let loose unloading the stockpile
a mental projectile i aim at the reptile
i look to the one handed juggler and ask him this
why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus
is there a reason for this the hindrance is aggravating
how many times will it take you before you realize you're fading
fading from existence cause simulations are dead
there's so much more to learn and pages left to be read
so put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor
while i hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty thor
words can weigh a ton
therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one
yeah it's another
very few have made an attempt to put in a foot on the other side
but i see no borderline from under this colorblind
and some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred
but then i'm finally about to put an end to the hatred
wrong the world would never endure to arguing
awaking to the absence of unity is startling
oh foolish pride what the hell are you trying to do
you cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to
your echoing words that mean nothing are despicable
so how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable
you're graceless bland you're tasteless and you're faceless faceless
damn you're dull it's time you faced this here taste this
straight from off of the pile one of the numerous styles
the date of my birth on the earth the deliverance of a starchild
blessed with formidable talent and versatility
but with such a power there comes a responsibility
to infringe on the boundaries so now the defiance is clear
to form an alliance is something even the giants fear
so instead of being oblivious to the color of skin
refusal of using is accepted now it's a trend
you know i don't understand why we all just can't get along
you hate me but you know me and what i stand for
no so then why do you speak for me
and every other white man when you that we're your enemy
on the floor lies a broken door cause i'm not to be spoken for
stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore
rarely do you see the lighter side of me
i try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry
but  is isolated apologies are exhausted
feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted
who can i trust after repeatedly being shafted
switch to the opposite now scenes are being re - enacted
pull up that boy by his roots destroy him quick
his fracture's obviating we hate him his patterns past us huh
always fighting for the position of top dog
that spot's already occupied and i don't play leapfrog
cause i do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine
but i'm always having to prove myself time after time
oh how i never understand how a man could be outcast
judged from the past and he's put last
and others with nothing to say
stuttering and slurring and muttering words with no meaning attack be signing like danny kaye
here i go again hammerin stammerin grammerin
and eat it like cheese pass me the crackers please
i've got a craving
yo alright yo
i'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while i'm sleeping
i keep dreaming of death and i'm hearing people screaming
the devil's spirit's trapped inside me and i want it out
i'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
with both of my wrists slit i'm lifted up in the air
and suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
i feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
while i choke on my own blood that i swallow and drown to death
but i found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
tripping over od'd bodies of dead lushes
bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
door's open and close by themselves books fly off shelves
curtains catch fire the house melts
my skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
the wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
caught a piece of shrapnel in the adam's apple
two cups of holy water and i'm looking at 'em half full
but as soon as i go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
it got silent then all these voices said
come follow me into the pits of hell
i heard 'em yell welcome to the norman bates motel
i ring the bell for service and i was greeted by his mother
covered in dry blood head still dented from the shovel
i said i need a room so i could try to get some rest
she gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
and told me that's just for starters satan'll be in to see me later
to see if i'm interested in being partners
fuck an intro man let's go
i come around like what goes around
what goes up must come down
anyone who comes up must go down
might as well go for the gusto now
better not let up better not let them breathe

2 bottles of lubriderm and a box of condoms is that all you brought

jackass eat a donkey dick
the game i just about conquered it like donkey kong
i'm bonkers bitch i'm the king of this honkey shit
i reign supreme in this honkey shit
no sense screaming and arguing
makes no difference whether a benz or bentley or a beamer's the car you in
you think you ball well i palm it
i throw up bombs when i vomit

cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
so they start smoking weed we'll never get our day
until we learn to pray keep our families in shape
cause they all broke and why do ghetto birds die
before we learn to fly some bodies else's child caught in guns
smoking weed can all make a change
so i'm told but i haven't seen the change unfold
i keep hoping please if you prefer to breathe
communities in need of people that will lead
keep your eyes open i can only say i'll try
until the day i die

let's pretend marshall mathers never picked up a pen
let's pretend things would have been no different
pretend he procrastinated had no motivation
pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin they could blow away with the wind
marshall you're never gonna make it makes no sense to play the game there aingt no way that you'll win
pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
and it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changing again
he wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
he had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
and he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
fuck a talent show in a gymnasium bitch you won't amount to shit quit daydreaming kid
you need to get your cranium checked you thinking like an alien and just aingt realistic
now pretend they aingt just make him angry with this shit
and there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed it
and his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap olympics
slept through his plane and he missed it
he's gon' have a hard time explaining to hailie and lainie these food stamps and this wic shit
cause he never risked shit he hoped and he wished it but it didn't fall in his lap so he aingt even here
he pretends that
they ask me am i okay
they ask me if i'm happy
are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
or am i just a little snappy
and they genuinely care
doody most of my life its just been me and you there
and i continuosly stare at pictures of you
i never gotta say i love you as much as i wanted to but i do
yeah i say it now and you can't hear me
what the fuck good does that do me now
but somehow i know you're near me in presence
oh i went and dropped some presents off easter to them
two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
and dawg you'll never believe this but sharonda actually talks to me now
jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
man how could you touch so many fucking lives and just leave us
they say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
if it's true how the fuck am i supposed to get over you
difficult as it sounds
doody that's what we called each other
i don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us
we was always brothers
never thought about each other's skin colours
'til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
it was like 90 degrees i was catching a sun burn
tryna walk under the trees
just to give me some comfort
i'm moaning i just wanna get home
when i look over and your shirt is off
i'm like you gonna fry and you're like
no i wont i'm black stupid
and black people they got melanin
in their skin we don't burn
meanwhile my face is glowing and i feel
like i'm on fire
and the entire time you're just laughing at me
and snapping at me with your shirt bastard
and i still have to get you back for that shit
and by the way them playboy rings
my mother stole from you
well nate finally got 'em back
shit it must have been at least 16 years ago
well i put 'em in your cask - oww
moving past it it still aingt registered yet
but you can bet your legacy they'll never forget
the motor city motown
hip hop vet hip hop shop dreads
it don't stop there
yeah as difficult as it sounds
and this may sound a little strange but i'mma tell it
i found that jacket that you left at my wedding
and i picked it up to smell it
i wrapped it up in plastic until i put it in glass
and hang it up in the hallway so i can always look at it
and as for all of me and d12 we feel like fuck rap
it feels like our general just fucking died in our lap
we shut off all our pagers
all our cell numbers has changed
our two - ways are in the trash
so some cats will have to find a new way
and i know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today
but the truth is there all still here and you aingt
purple gang you gotta keep pressing on
don't ever give up the dream dawg
i got love for you all
and doody it's true you bought people together who never
woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
you were the peacemaker doody
i know sometimes you were moody
but you hated confrontation
and truly hated the feuding
but you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping
if it had to happen it had to happen
believe me i know you're the one who taught me to
throw them balls back on dresden
from making cars to paintballing
getting arrested
to sitting across from each other in cells laughing and jesting
they tried to hit us for 5 years for that no question
i guess them hookers and bums that we shot up
didn't show up for court
so we got off on a technicality left sweating
me you and what's his face
i forgot his fucking name
shame he even came to your funeral
he betrayed our team
and if i see him again i'ma punch him in the fucking face
and that's on hallie jade whitney lane and alaina's name
i let the pistol bang once just to leak a shot in the air
for you and pour some liquor out for you with obie in the parking lot of 54
just before we were supposed to get in cars
to come and see you once more
oh all around the world
there's an echo
as he takes a bow
and they all know all the girls the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo echo echo echo
i can hear them calling calling calling calling calling
i eat rappers with the rhyme consume 'em
the only fucking thing that you consume is time
i'm super human my world is like a rubik's cube
it's too complex girl you assuming cupids looming
my mentality's caveman stupid woman
my life is truman show all i have is music hoe
i stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago
so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
cause you better put a fork in it if you think i'm a lay here just spooning yo
oh you think you the shit 'cause i just said you was beautiful
diabolical till the last molecule down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
rotten to the core to the bunghole all the way down to my soul from my head to my toe
ever since i was thirteen i learned how to sew so shut my own booty hole
cause i aingt took no shit since i looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
i told these stupid hoes when i come back i'm a set this bitch on fire
and this time i don't mean i'm a pour gasoline on some chick and light her
cause this time when i fuck this world i'm put my whole god - damn dick inside her
i aingt even put my tip in that hoe yet
i'm go get nickel and try to rip it wider
classical poems
battle my own demons
i need a glass of patron
bad as i need a horn
stabbing my clavicle bone
i'm matador prone
first time i seen a desert eagle
i was letting the 44 buss
the 44 pop
first time you seen one you was eating coco puffs
looking at robocop
i'm not a man i'm a logo i'm sustain
in order to clean my veins you need saline
i'm never referring to the solution
i'm talking about more like the mustang vroom
get respect from the get - go hello
set to the echo psycho
pen got a mind of it's own gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise
i'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
as the echo follows the maserati
as the petrol swallows
i'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton
check your bible inside it it will say this guys an elephant
i'm fly like i'm killing the scene like i'm a villain with wings
i'll sleep when i'm 6 feet deep
right now i'm living a dream
though we may be reckless
the ladies check us
they whisper shady records
baby echo
cause baby i'm lonely
can somebody hold me
it feel like i'm fallin now i can't hold my ground
it feels like i'm only
trying but slowly
it feels like i'm fallin now i can't hold my ground
no more
probably one of my realest loves ever four page letters
in time its all better cause time heal whatever
i'mma need a moment cause moments last forever
cars with cream leather females are on regular
whats the point in titles we liking it how they tell us
id rather stay friends with benefits 'til we ready
now ready sean don got me feeling heavy
she like one more chance more problems no biggie ah
its all good dont take it the wrong way
aint nothing personal but who this nigga in your face
we can leave together or you can take your space
the night young we should head over to my place
ha now we laughing and all that
tell your friend they can fall back
aint even gotta ask twice
she said what you feeling like
i'm like
you can be black white or albino yeah
you can have cornrows inside your hair
think you just don't say it and i won't say it
i don't need ya'll to co - sign no shit
little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
the rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
and i can be so quite and strike so fast
like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast
i don't wanna say goodbye
but sometimes things just don't go as we'd like
all i wanna do is cry
say my farewells pack up and leave tonight
farewell miss i know that you can care less
but i'm sorry for everything i was careless
but i need you to know that i love you so much
and i've been drinking myself to sleep my soul's crushed
a couple more shots i know i'm gonna go nuts
i can't deal with the fact you left me with no crutch
i was in love with you how could you do this to me
actually i did this to myself what a tragedy
and now what do i do
where do i go
cause everywhere i go i see your face
it's hard starting over
trying to find another shoulder
to lean on
i feel like my whole life just got peed on
they say time heals but dammit i wanna stop time and feel this pain
as crazy as it sounds to me it's sane
and i like it why 'cause i feel like we're still united
in some weird way i don't wanna fight it
i wrote you the other day and you didn't write back
it's like that after all the crap we been through
i can't believe you i know i fucked up
but look within you and find some love and stop being stuck up
you keep sending me to voicemail
i'm annoyed hell shit you coulda at least sent a text
but you're probably busy kissing someone else's lips
while i'm sitting here cleaning my shoes from this shit
you're hard headed a sharp headache
i need help call a medic
i just cut myself yeah i did it
without you i'm nothing don't you get it
every time that i said i loved you i meant it
you turn and tell me you hate me and regret that
we ever met i can't believe you just said that
you're so cold you just hit me so low
i can't take this no more so hit the road
some things just don't seem the way they do
one day you tell me i love you and only you
i wake up to find out it was a dream
you're telling me you hate me you're leaving me
people change everything changes
we go from best friends then become strangers
we go from seeing each other everyday then
farewell to never seeing your face again
i can't get you outta of my head
so i'm out of bed at 4 in the morning
wishing i was dead
but for some odd reason i can't do it
for some reason i needed to write
what's on my mind and what's going through it
cause if i don't i'll probably suffocate
why do you have so much hate
towards me you need some loving babe
god i fucking love you i hate myself
for falling in love with you
just to find out all i did was trouble you
my heart is aching i'm medicated
i tried meditating
but nothing works i don't even feel sedated
i wish you could feel what i feel for one second
i reckon you would jump out your window bare naked
fuck humiliation you do anything to get me back
opinions wouldn't matter what they thought in fact
you would tell everyone to fuck themselves good
and do everything to have me if you could
exclimate is that what you said
my next defense against these extra men
who try to step to me and wanna have sex again
you little sickass i'll spray em with gasoline
they try to jack me off with vaseline
my ass is mean i smash your spleen
when i crash the scene
with a cell phone now who the hell is home
y'all can't tell paul how to throw me words
cause animal crackers is what i do when i eat mc's like a cannibal backwards
ha ha i got it that's not it
fake rappers been spotted
like broken headphones you head home you sped home
you get your head blown rappers try to step they speak in the dead tones
so i aingt trying to hear them give me another word for your mother
stretch armstrong my brother coming with rhymes every time that i be drumming
running with this shit when i kick a bitch in the stomach
and star wars this car's a taurus
yo how many bars we hit tonight cause i'm drunk off

with fresh vegetables my testicles are hanging off to the left of you

microphone cause i'mma be honest any mc who tries to step to this

that nostradamus is blowing up your house killing your foster mammas
and coming back to get your parents well i have it
these rhymes are fourteen karat solid gold
rappers step to me you get your wallet stole
in times square i got blonde hair i'm higher than con air
rappers don't want to see me i'll butt fuck goldie hawn bare
in a lawn chair cause i'm there
with kurt russell saying come here goldie you want my love muscle
i know you want it i get blunted then i
kick these freestyles just like whipped knees
with a taxicab i'll smack a bitch with a maxi pad
where we going don't ask me dad
leave me alone i'm not trying to even hear you
dad i hope you're fucking dying off this porno mag
yo did you see my ad yo wait a minute did you see my ass
is what i meant to say i meant to say a rhyme that goes this way is elementary
for the century slim shady's is gonna be the illest
what flamingos my mother goes out and plays bingo
every single day at the bingo hall that's why my dick is single small
didn't blow up just don't give a what a cuff
but dt's fired he's retired he's not hired yo plus i'm tired
of busting and spitting this rhyme nonstop i'm on top
taking records to the pawnshop stretch
damn see my big ick catch
put a d in front of it rappers don't want none of it
coming with a ton of shit to spill slim shady out i get ill with the skill
baby aight baby slim shady
kick eighty million rhymes till i'm older than grady
spilled gravy all over my damn navy blue avi
bye bye
yo man yo marsh man you've been kicking all this shit about yourself what about the homies man
ai you want one about the posse aight 
oh foolish pride oh oh oh oh foolish pride
oh oh ph ohh
foolish pride oh oh oh oh foolish pride
well foolish pride has alot of things to say
you got foolish pride you got tooth decay
but tooth decay is another problem
so let's take this old foolish pride and solve it
now when i talk about foolish pride
i mean blacks & whites taking different sides
when blacks and whites take different sides
unity never happens and we will subside
we will subside and hatred will release
and everything will just crush that peace
well when we crush that peace we start hating each other
but remember you are my brother and you are my sister
just like i'm a mister
i seen a black girlfriend and i kissed her
i kissed her; i placed it on her cheek
and she didn't come back til next week
now it was next week and she was back again
wanting to kiss a white kid
so she was my girlfriend we started going out
but that's okay because we were black and white
blacks and whites they sometimes mix
but black girls only want your money cause they're dumb chicks
so i'ma say like this
don't date a black girl take it as a diss
if you want but if you don't
i'ma tell you like this i surely won't
never date a black girl because blacks only want your money
and that shit aingt funny
so i'ma say look honey
why do you do this
you know you step up to me like you a brutus
then you try to grab my spinach
because its green and that's cash
so get outta here 'cause i don't need your ass
i said that before but that's okay because like i said you're a whore
black girls and white girls just don't mix
because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks
white girls are good; i like white girls
i like white girls all over the world
white girls are fine and they blow my mind
and that's why i'm here now telling you this rhyme
'cause black girls i really don't like
we don't mix it's like riding a bike
when you're peddling hard uphill both ways
you know it's kinda hard and that's why i say to you
i'm giving you a little advice
don't date a black girl if you do it once you won't do it twice
you won't ever do it again because they'll take your money
and that aingt funny
i thought i said that before
but like i said again you're nothing but a big whore
so when mike catch on the bass line
that's okay 'cause we will not just waste time
i'll get straight to the point
black girls are bitches that's why i'ma tell ya you better pull up your britches
'cause all that cash is making your ass drag
from the boyfriend ya ganked and that's pretty bad
i mean that's pretty sad when ya dating a black guy
and then you turn around and fuck another big black guy
now that's pretty wrong but you're just ganking
but that's okay because you need a goddamn spanking
from me the funky eminem
i'm busting rhymes and i'm swallowing phlegm
i'm busting a freestyle just like this
i say swallowing phlegm and howard gets pissed
but when howard gets pissed that's okay
because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days
so i'll just worry about that problem when i come to it
i cross that bridge when i come to it
because i forgot the chorus
but that's okay 'cause y'all saying bust a rhyme for us
so i'ma bust another rhyme about this black girl
she turned out to be a fucking wack girl
a wack girl because black girls aingt funny
all they want is your godamn money
they take you for everything you got
and then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand
so i'ma kick it to you just like this
how does the chorus go i forgot
but that's okay 'cause i'ma tell you in stride
i'ma say oh foolish pride
oh oh oh oh foolish pride oh oh oh oh foolish pride
oh oh oh oh foolish pride oh oh oh
date a white girl 'cause they got the raw hide
i done figured this rap shit out
i map shit out strategically
timing is everything and that seems to be the key
to my success it's worked for me repeatedly
let 'em diss you first and respond immediately
and order the mask til they want a war don't start a war
shit not no more we done scared em off there are no more
victims to stick i'm fixin to pick some and start shit
i'm outta 
pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
aingt got no more targets shit irv and jeff
we done beat em to death benzino went deaf
there seems to just be no one left to bully
bush is pussy
why the fuck you think his name's bush
puss is bushy

i'm thinkin of doin some shit to get you to go and hate me again
to tell the truth i liked the shit better then

summaladoomalama
i'm not a human i'm a supersonic neurobonic suicidal unibomber
you think i'm a nuisce i'm impressive i'm the new madonna
jeffery dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on
a lotta talk and rumors honest whos the hottest to be honest
hip hop aingt been the same since tupac moved to cuba on us
fuck it friends or no friends i had enough bullshit to last me clear to the end
i shoulda been able to see that you were the one behind this
but i was blind as fuck to think that you weren't the kind that stuck some more in the spine this
it was as if our friendship broke in half
and watch you turn everything into a game and joke and laugh
and both of us know we can't discuss the situation
like adults each confrontation just results in accusations and insults
so i'ma just let it go for now
and leave you be it's over now
what goes around comes back around
believe you me lay low for now come here you fucking
come here you fucking backstabber
why i oughta beat a bitch nigga from the hood haha
why i oughta beat a nigga that's up to no good haha
why don't you take a second to stop and think about what you done
and you want to call that being a friend that isn't what you want
all because of what you run your mouth you wanna prance around and gloat
let's see how well you dance around when i got my hands around your throat
cause it's a matter of time till i get my blows in and it won't be long
you shouldn't go walking around and sticking your nose in where it don't belong
cause every time you talked when you was stretchin the truth
theres gonna be one more flying knuckle you're gonna catch in the tooth
come here come here you fucking
come here you lil double - crossing goin behind my back snitcher
good for nothin but trouble causin instigating fact switcher
you were the least that i suspected
till the puzzle fell into place with every piece that i selected
but i'll never let that crap happen again
you come back blabbing again
catch it smack dab in the chin
that's for backstabbin a friend
cause every name in the book
wouldn't be enough
so i just figured i'd say your name in the hook
check it out come here you fuckin
backstabbers don't live too long
around my way friendships betrayed
in the hood you die for that
for those that don't love this combat and verbally say this
this could relate to the death of a backstabber

at 10 pounds when i was born i didn't give her no pain
although through the years i gave her her fair share
i gave her her first real scare
i made it from birth and i got here
she knows my purpose wasn't purpose
i aingt perfect i care
but i feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matchin my gear
now i'm just scratchin the surface cause what's burried under there
was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
i went to school got good grades could behave when i wanted
but i had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted

yo slim shady
yo i'll fuckin i'll
i'll puke eat it and freak you 
battle i'm too weeded to speak to
the only key that i see to defeat you
would be for me to remove these two adidas and beat you
and force feed you 'em both and on each feet is a cleat shoe
i'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse 
you'll think i pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you 
 i aingt no fuckin g i'm a cannibal 
i aingt tryin to shoot you 
i'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
wrap you in rope and plastic stab you with broken glass 
and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
coke and acid black magic cloaks and daggers 
fuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis
i'm so bananas i'm showin up to your open casket
to fill it full of explosive gasses
and close it back with a lit match in it 
while i sit back and just hope it catches 
blow you to fragments
laugh roll you and smoke the ashes
i see the light at the end
but every time i take a step it gets dim
tell me is this hell we're livin in
if so heaven's got to be better
but if we're hellbound whatever let's go down
am i the worst because i never go to church 
i run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
i'ma drink 'til my liver rot see the doc
leave the er then hit a bar for a liquor shot 'til the liver spot
one day we all gon' die
but when i die i'ma be so high
that i'ma get up and walk leavin the concrete bare
with the chalk outline still there
i smoke 'til i choke and i sex a lot
i got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
now if i pray everynight 
do i still have to hold my trey very tight
you feel me god i done did so much shit while on earth
i smoke i drink i curse and to make matters worse
i bust my gun first and then i chat with your corpse
since way back i was one to never like back - talk
see me at the pearly gates in line wearin a nordface
nickle nine at my waist god done lost faith
angels greet me but i don't reply back
just show me to my quarters and oh yeah where's thai at
maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
final battle fight
analyze the strength of my game like lee corso
call me a lost soul with a vest on my torso
and of course yo y'all know i'm no stranger to danger
like christ in a manger feel a whole range of my anger
i breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
and beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
my pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger walk with a swagger
tie your wife to the back of a black jag and i drag her
ten blocks untie the bitch and i still bag her
give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
my shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
my flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
everyday i grow more older and more colder
fly you to colorado roll you over with a boulder
i know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care
time's up
you lose
katta ne
i'm about to lose my mind
youve been gone for so long im running outta time
i need a doctor call me a doctor
i need a doctor doctor to bring me back to life
i told the world one day i would pay it back
say it on tape and lay it record it so that one day i could play it back
but i dont even know if i believe it when im saying that
doubts starting to creep in every day it's just so grey and black
hope i just need a ray of that 'cause no one sees my vision
when i play it for em they just say it's wack but they dont know what dope is
and i dont know if i was awake or asleep when i wrote this
all i know is you came to me when i was at my lowest
you picked me up breathed new life in me i owe my life to you
but for the life of me i don't see why you don't see like i do
but it just dawned on me you lost a son demons fighting you its dark
let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
i don't think you realize what you mean to me not the slightest clue
'cause me and you were like a crew i was like your sidekick
you gon' either wanna fight when i get off this fucking mic
or you gon' hug me but i'm outta options there's nothing else i can do 'cause
it hurts when i see you struggle you come to me with ideas
you say they're just pieces so im puzzled 'cause the shit i hear is crazy
but you're either getting lazy or you dont believe in you no more
seems like your own opinions not one you can form
can't make a decision you keep questioning yourself
second guessing and it's almost like your begging for my help
like im your leader you're supposed to fucking be my mentor
i can endure no more i demand you remember who you are
it was you who believed in me when everyone was telling
you don't sign me everyone at the fucking label let's tell the truth
you risked your career for me i know it as well as you
nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy dre im crying in this booth
you saved my life now maybe it's my turn to save yours
but i can never repay you what you did for me is way more
but i aingt giving up faith and you aingt giving up on me
get up dre i'm dying i need you come back for fucks sake 'cause
bring me back to life
it literally feels like a lifetime ago
but i still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
you walked in yellow jump suit whole room cracked jokes
once you got inside the booth told you mic smoke
went through friends some of them i put on but they just left
they said they was riding to the death but where the fuck are they now
now that i need them i don't see none of them
all i see is slim fuck all you fair - weather friends all i need is him
fucking backstabbers when the chips were down you just laughed at us
now you bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath faggots
you gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been
you can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots
and the crackers' ass little cracker jack beat
making wack math backwards producers i'm back bastards
one more cd and then im packing up my bags and as im leaving
ill guarantee they scream dre dont leave us like that man 'cause
your mother you fuckin faggot
la da da da da da da da 
aiyo this next song is dedicated to the memory of erik schrody
rest in peace we aint forget about you you fuckin homo
we still remember
there once was a man who liked to jump around 
but he got too old to jump up and down 
so he put the mic down and picked the guitar up 
started singin the blues like there's no tomorrow 
 left his boys in the house of pain 
it was the wisest decision he ever made 
but the dumbest thing he could ever do 
was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady
tell me now what you gonna do 
cause i remember all those years
how it was when you were here
i remember how it was how it was when you were young
yesterday was so long ago 
kid rock and limp bizkit came along now
don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more
i remember back when you had the knack 
and i remember when you had your first heart attack 
i was right there laughin when i heard the news 
i just wish the cardiac would'a murdered you 
maybe ice - t's right you are a bitch 
you come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich 
but the dumbest thing that you could ever do 
yo  yo  yo 
remember back in '94 like right before ms everlast was whitey ford
before his heart attack had him on life support
when house of pain was out of fame like someone doused the flame
and they became destined to never jump around again 
or even further back when i first had heard the knack
and you were down with syndicate i went to get your shit man
i was into it
but then you went and took your style and switched the shit
now you sound ridiculous you dickless piece of shit
how could you diss me bitch
i liked you thought you was alright for a white dude
remember sway and tech when i came up and sat beside you
started rhymin then you left the room 
and didn't say goodbye or nothin
like you mad that someone else was
white and tried to rhyme or somethin
i'm sorry man i wasn't tryin to steal your light or nothin
but you're a homosexual white rappin irish 
man i wish i was irish i could be a  too
then i'd be confused as you and i wouldn't know what to do
what's up with you 
i never fucked with you why would you fuck with me
knowin i could rap circles around you what you nuts as me
plus i can sing better than you and i don't fuckin sing
and probably play guitar better and i aingt never touched a string
but i aingt mad at you i'd hate me too if i was you
i'm what you used to be shit you was me in '92
so everytime i write a lyric i'mma think of you
and maybe that'll help me know what it's like to sing the blues
you fuckin punk pussy you fuckin faggot sissy fuck
and by the way a 380's a fuckin sissy gun
if you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin real gun
you little bitch
next time say my fuckin name in a song
don't be subliminal about it
you wanna fuckin diss me diss me you fuckin faggot
you fuckin punk pussy you fuckin little bitch fuckin cunt
damn it feels good to be back
i'm having a relapse
how the hell did he manage
to get more felony charges
he's already got life in jail
man what the hell is his problem
well to be honest the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
they compelled me
to kill this elderly man
and i get these panic attacks
pop a xanax relax
try to stick my fucking dick
inside a mannequins ass
then i get manic depressed
and the orthodontist get gas masked
kick ass
the first thing i'll put on is the mask
speaking of masks man
it aint to late to have a change of pace
and take it off and show my face
so you can see the things you face
and slice you up
and cook you after your murder
by strangulation
thats bacon souffle
you making aint you
well thank you jason
there goes one more coma
due to blunt force trauma
just give me one more soma
and i'll be done for it mama
go in the damn broom closet
another valium lost it
shovin the vacuums nozzle
down the bathroom faucet
it seems like every day i get a little flakier
the medication is making my hands a little shakier
hand me that 18 month old baby
to shake him up
it'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
breaking his neck in 80 some places
baby here shady comes lady

theres something inside of that blue tarp
and that drum drum
a head and torso of someone
where'd it come from
who's it belong to
maybe that girl with the long blond hair
who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom poms
clearly theres some'n wrong
'cause she didn't come home
shes missing
where is she
something fishy is going on
i guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
now everybody get your dance on
to my damn song
if i die young bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song
she got that good good she michael jackson bad
i'm attracted to her for her attractive ass
and now we're murderers because we kill the time
i knock her lights out and she still shine
i hate to see her go but i love to watch her leave
but i keep her running back and forth like a soccer team
cold as a winter day hot as a summer's eve
young money thieves steal your love and leave
i like the way you walk and if you're walking my way
i'm that red bull now let's fly away
let's buy a place with all kind of space
i let you be the judge n' n' and i'm the case
i'm gudda gudda i put her under
i see me with her no stevie wonder
she don't even wonder coz she know she bad
and i got her nigga grocery bag
god i'm a daddy i'm so glad that her mom didn't
now you probably get this picture from mu public persona
that i'm a pistol packing drug addict who bags on his mama
cause there's a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside my soul
and just know that i grow cold of the older i grow
and this load is like the weight of the world and i think my neck is breaking
should i just give up or live up to these excpetations
now look i love my daughter more than life itself
so many chances man it's too bad coulda had someone else
but the years that i've wasted is nothing to the tears that i've tasted
so here's what i'm facing 3 felonies 6 years of probation
i've went to jail for this woman i've been to bat for this woman
i've taken bats to people's back bent over backwards for this woman
check check 121212 
yea yea yea dr dre up in here y'all know what this is
it's what y'all been waiting for funk master flex big kap
def jam records giving it to you baby
yo eminem show these mother fuckers what time it is baby
i used to be a lonely man only mad until i got a million dollars shit
now if i only had some fucking hair i'd pull it faster than a bullet
out of tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
i'm trying to grow it back again it was an accident
i had my back against the fan and chopped it off in amsterdam
i hate the straight jacket it aint latching and can't lock it
so they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
the cell's padded and battered like someone else had it
before me and just kept throwing they fucking self at it
my head is aching i'm dedicated to medication
but this med is taking too long to bring me this sedadation 
anyway i got down with dre 
the first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
running up and down the street screaming fuck the police
when you still had your mother's fucking nipple stuck in your teeth  
became a role model after colorado
now all they do is follow me around and holla bravo
hell yea i punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
suck my dick bitch
i'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but i won't
cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place
so put a sock in it with your fake - ass tupac image
you faggots aingt tough you just get drunk and become talkative  
i'm probably the akwardest alcoholic talking
walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
so when you see me on your block stumbling mumbling
a bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
i aingt buzzed i'm just high on life
so why on earth would i need drugs when i can fly on kites motherfucker slim shady
i'm drunk pass the tec
cause if i get locked up tonight
then i might not come home tonight
keep it moving off and on eminem is on
off and on dr dre is on
the whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
i set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron 
psych i'm just joking for christ sake
dont get so bent out of shape
cause i went out and raped six girlfriends
some people just don't get it but i won't let it upset me
cause they don't know better
they don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up
and fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
my mind's got a mind of it's own sometimes i can't find it at home
it hides in the stove 
shit talk about your brain being baked
my shit's still in the oven on 480 degrees
hailey jade daddy loves you baby
don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter fuck you lady
you critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize
individuals lives through a criminal's eyes
the neighborhood that i grew up in you could die for nothing
and dirty dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
i'll have a fucking man raped with a band - aid over his mouth
and shove his head in the fan blade
don't ever tell me what i can and what i can't say
or change cause of the age - range in my fan base
like i give a fuck who's buying this shit
quit fucking buying it i'm tired bitch i'm dying to quit
hip - hop is universal now it's all commercial now
it's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
but now the white kids like it so they tell me i can buy it
but as soon as i get on the mic it's like the night gets silent
either that or booed thats why i keep an attitude
and go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
i'm sick of being judged fuck it let me see a judge
i'll confess to every murder i committed since 3 years old
fuck that turn that shit off
let's get the fuck out of here
you know how we do 
ah yeah 
this is eminem baby back up in that motherfucking ass
one time for your motherfucking mind 
we represent the 313 you know what i'm saying
yo they don't know shit about this for the '96
ayo my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
to get your brain relaxing the zany acting maniac in action
you look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
i travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills
i'm sliming grills of roaches with spray that disinfects
and twisting necks of rappers
'til their spinal column disconnects
put this in decks and check the monologue
turn your system up twist 'em up
and indulge in the marijuana smog
examination of more car - tunes than animation
hits a snare and bass on a track for duck rapper interrogation
when i declare invasion
there aingt no time to be staring gazing
i'm infinite; you heard of hell
well i was sent from it
i went to it serving a sentence
for murdering instruments
but when i hear the beat i'm tempted
to make another attempt at it; i'm infinite
bust it i let the beat commence
so i can beat the sense in your elite defense
i got some meat to mince
a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse
i foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
my coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
one thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep - full of people
mc's are feeble i came to cause some pandemonium
battle a band of phony mc's and stand the lonely one
imitator intimidator stimulator
simulator of data eliminator
my thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
my a cappella releases classic masterpieces
through telekinesis it eases you mentally
gently sentimentally instrumentally
man i got evidence i'm never dense
and i've been clever ever since my residence was hesitant
to do some shit that represents the mo
'cause there's a monster will in me
that always wants to kill mcs
mic nestler slamming like a wrestler
no one else is specialer my skill is intergalactical
so this is for my family the kid who had a cameo
on my last jam plus the man who never had a plan b
i'm tensed a bit and tempted
when i see the sins my friends commit
'95 '96 
and on and on and on 
so let's get down to business
i don't got no time to play around what is this
 what is this what is this
the invasion 
green lantern the infiltration we coming 
i got 50 cent i got g - unit
d - tweezy in this bitch wit obie trice
so watch what you say 'fore you call our name
cause you say one more thing and it won't be nice
whoa here we go i should've' known
i was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
sooner or later you little haters
are too jealous of us to love us
you hate it g - unit made it and obie's coming
d - tweezy's coming you're sick to your stomach
50 percent of it's 50 cent
the other 50 percent of it's who's color of skin it is
but if you even considering taking our label down
you better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
but i aingt trying to get too intricate into it
i'm just trying to you give you a little hint for your own benefit
cause then it's gonna get to the point
where it escalates to some other shit
then i'm a flip then i'm a get to
stomping in my air force ones
but you won't be able to tell
if it's two pairs or it's one
it's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
you'd think nike just made these into cleats in this shoe
i don't know what it is or what it could be
but i get a woody when these pussies try to push me
thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me
y'all tickle me pink
i think i'd just rather have pink tickle me
hickory dickory dock tickety tock tickety
a little bit of the diggedy doc diggedy
mixed with a little bit of the
jigga - ja - jigga
wit a small pinch of biggie
look at me i'm just the bomb diggedy
we the realest label
don't try to act like you don't feel our label
cause we gonna fuck around and kill your label
obie d - tweezy g - unit 50
we the label for sure
cause we gonna fuck around and steal your paper
we gonna kill your fucking label for sure
shady in the place to be see
and i got what it takes to +roc the mic+ right
still watch what you say to me punk
cause i'm off probation in less than six months 
haha shady records
still aftermath and don't think we don't
hear you motherfuckers talking
cause we do and we see y'all
we just gonna sit back for a minute
while i see what the fuck y'all do
i've got a riddle whats little and talks big
with midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle
thatll do anything to throw dirt on my name
if it means walking the whole mediterranean
is he an albanian armenian iranian tazmanian
no it's dave raymond and oh osorio
so sorry whoa but that was a long time ago
when i was just joe shmo rapping in joe blows basement
i apologized fo it before so
either accept it or you dont
and lets move on if i aingt shown that ive grown
then get the bone keep licking these nuts
you industry mutts keep walking around sniffing each others butts
or should i say asses
what would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses
the question i ask is
how can i explain this
how can i swing this in english language
if i switch to slang and turn mayn to mayn
do i do it in vain or simply to entertain
am i being real or am i being fake
am i just a fraud or am i truly genuine
or am i caught up in this hot water
woady on my daughter i told you i love this culture
dont let em insult ya ima tell you one more gain
this is the environment that i was brought up in
but every now and then i use my pen
to get rid of some frustration or should i say shon
is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism
your face is numb youre stunned you look as cold
like that of a man whos 70 some years old
and it only gets colder which is why i understand
i cant be mad at a forty four year old fan
with a chip on his shoulder
who only owns half of a magazine and the only way to have it seen
is to put me on the front of it again
only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown
papa cant stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the *** down
in his new chair that goes round and round
that he bought from new money in his bank account
that i get him every issue when the thang comes out
sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
and let his black side arm wrestle his white side
yell apartheid loud enough that he might slide
he might find someone dumb enough who might ride
but aingt nobody over here buying two white guys
disguised as pro - black theres no slack for a hartford college grad
in a fitted hat and a hunch back standing by the clearance coat rack
in some old slacks and some rso throwbacks yeah
let it go
gotta let it go
keep living your life cause its your time
your time your time your time
you gotta let it go
have you ever loved someone so much
you'd give an arm for
and you know you are there armor
and you would destroy anyone that would try to harm her
but what happens when karma
turns right around and bites you
what happens when you become the main source of the pain
'daddy look what i made' 
'daddy's gotta go catch a plane'
'daddy wheres mommy
i cant find mommy where is she'
'i don't know go play hailie baby your daddy's busy'
daddy's writing a song
this song aingt gon' write itself
i'll give you one underdog
and you gotta swing by yourself
then turn right around in that song
and tell her you lover her
and put hands on her mother
who's a spitting image of her
thats slim shady
yeah baby slim shady's crazy
shady made me but tonight
shadys rock - a - by - baby

'baby daddy aingt leaving no more'
'daddy your lyin you always say that

but you aingt leavin no more daddy your mine'
she's piling boxes infront of the door
tryin to block it
'daddy please daddy don't leave daddy no stop it'

pulls out a tiny necklace locket

'this will keep you safe daddy take it witcha'

what happened 
we stopped rappin 
gun clappinand all i need is one napkin to wipe the cum off
when i come off with the drum off
whatever the hell that meantbut i can still speak wit a accent
a french accent excuse my french but 
suck my dick touche le le poouhhbitch
bonjuori'm here with the cureoh yea lets rock it for the drawer
hey emhow you doin this is methe em jockget off my
damn cock laughing
here to stay
even when i'm gone
when i close my eyes
through the passage of time
kings never die
i can hear the drummer drumming
and the trumpets someone's tryna summon someone i know somethings coming
but i'm running from it to be standing at the summit
and plummet how come it wasn't what i thought it was
was it too good to be true
have nothing get it all but too much of it
then lose it again did i swallow hallucinogens
cause if not where the hell did it go
cause here i sit in lucifers den by the dutch oven
just choosing to sin
even if it means i'm selling my soul just to be the undisputed again
do whatever i gotta do just to win
cause i got this motherfucking cloud over my head
crown around it thorns on it
cracks in it bet you morons didn't think i'd be back did ya
how 'bout that im somehow now back to the underdog
but no matter how loud that i bark this sport is something i never bow - out at
i complain about the game i shout and i pout it's a love - hate
but i found out that i can move a mountain of doubt
even when you bitches are counting me out and i appear to be down for the count
only time i ever been out and about
is driving around town with my fucking whereabouts in a doubt
cause i been lost tryna think of what i did to get here but i'm not a quitter
gotta get up give it all i got or give up
spit on shit on stepped on but kept going
i'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like i slept on my neck wrong
cause you're moving onto the next but is the respect gone
cause someone told me that
don't give me that sob story liar don't preach to the choir
you aingt never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
nobody ever handed me shit in life not even a flyer
wouldn't even take shit into consideration
obliterate anyone in the way
i think i see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me
but it'd actually have to be a fucking blow - out to get me to re - tire
tell these new artists that kings never die
i know shit has changed in this age fuck a twitter page
did it just say i've been upstaged
why am i online it's driving me crazy
i'm riding shotgun tryna get a gauge
on what's hot but i'm not one to conform
but as days pass in this shit
and opinions sway i can hear 'em say
if i stay passionate maybe i can stage a miraculous
comeback as if i went away
but detractors just say so much for the renegade
someone's gonna make me blow my composure
here i go again center stage and i feel like i'm in a cage
they so want a champion to fall
it's no wonder why i laugh at 'em cause why can't we win 'em all
so fuck what these cynics say
 just goes ta show that when my back's against the wall
and i'm under a tack again that i'll act as if i'm 'posed ta
with this pent up rage cause all these plaques in my office
on the floor stacked against the door
are they just metaphors for the odds of me coming back again
cause all the accomplishments accolades awards
and trophies just don't mean jack anymore
if i'm here today and gone tomorrow
and i'm not gonna be
i want it i'm coming to get it
so you son of a bitches don't duck youre gonna get riddick bowed
critics'll end up in critical think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked
and i'm not stopping 'til i'm on top again all alone and on a throne
like a token of respect or a homage poem or an ode i've been owed
tossed in the air by my own arm and launched so hard it broke my collarbone
and when it's my time to go i'm still not leaving
stop for no one i don't know but i've been told an obstacle that
blocks your road knock it over time to go for that pot of gold cause
they say kings never die
just ask jam master jay
they just grow wings and they fly
so hands up reach for the sky
try to hold and prolong these moments
cause in a blink of an eye
they'll be over
tryna secure your legacy like shakur
and ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
so before you're leaving this earth
you want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
deacon of words syllable genius at work
plus i'm thinking that they're mistaking my kindness for weakness kill 'em with meanness
i went from powdered milk and farina
to flipping burgers on the grill for some peanuts
from gilbert's to arenas call me gilbert arenas still appeal to the dreamers
i made it to the silverscreen but rocky's still what the theme is
khalil on the beat cause making the beat aint the same feeling to me as killing the beat is
or fulfilling to me is what filling a seat is
it's that sound bombing thirsting howl
common underground diamond d outsidaz
stomach growl throbbing hunger out - rhyming everyone
god just give me one shot i swear that i won't let you down
i'mma be around forever - and - a - day even in the ground
you aingt never ever gonna hear 'em say i aingt
i know theres something in the wake of your smile
i get a notion from the look in your eyes yeah
weve built a love but that love falls apart
a little piece of heaven turns to dark
listen to your heart
there's a certain mystique when i speak
that you notice that it's sorta unique
cause you know it's me my poetry's deep
and i'm still matic the way i flow to this beat
you can't sit still it's like tryin to smoke crack
and go to sleep i'm strapped
just knowing any minute i could snap
i'm the equivalent of what would happen if bush rapped
i bully these rappers so bad lyrically
it aingt even funny i aingt even hungry
it aingt even money you can't pay me enough
for you to play me it's cockamamie
you just aingt zany enough to rock with shady

there's no humor in it no more you know
i'm rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
you need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
it's a different ball game you call names and you aingt just rapping
and asked him not to start it he wasn't going to go after him
until ja started yapping in magazines how he stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash him mash him and let him have it
meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
cause daddy felt like a bum see daddy had a job
almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
yeah bad and evil is 
we bout to get into a tail of gunner that details the dungeon
this is the pale moon illuminates the hail and thundering
oh once again where i fail from blundering
shady lifted his wing than i fell from under it
now i'm freefalling
my career is gone and the weed calling
regardless of who's fault i was b - balling
god bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the earth
marshall double backed and got me from on top of the hearse
i'm alive nigga justin t aingt got nothing on me
cause i done cried mary j blige rivers
i realized that god's with us as soon as i decided to put that bottle down and pick up my tie bridges
the writings on the wall since niggas seen me at the baseball game with shady and jay - z
suddenly everybody calls
like i'm just checking on you dog
while i throw up this message on the star
when them bottles stop popping
and them dollars start stopping
do what you did to get it and dont stop 
i made a promise to my momma
i'mma out live her
how can i be a quitter when haters dont stop 
i'm living proof nigga
its pretty safe to say
god giveth and god taketh away
its the worldwide american way
your body language is saying your confidence is gone
well pick ya ass up lil homie come on
you just gone sit there and take it or make em suck it
tell em where to shove it straight up you gon' make love to the world or you gon' fuck it
the last time the light kicked me in the ass

without remorse man
man of course i'm a one trick pony
cause i'll be screaming on these whores till i'm hoarse

i'd rather stay and rap

i find excitement in wondering what i'ma write next
so i dont stay in debt

you might aswell cut the embryo out my momma and play catch with the baby
with ak's with baby bayonet's
i'ma get rich or i'mma die trying
thats why its either kill or be killed
so call me suicide homocide ryan
theres a bomb inside my head
i'ma live wire i am on the edge
teetering on it like i tore the iron mike
get on a nut like a tyre iron
i have no desire stopping so why would i drop and roll
that's how much on fire i am
rappers are fun and i'm the time cause i'm just flying by 'em
man i'm laughing at 'em the entire time why am i up
cause tribulations i have triumphed bitch i'm fired up
so it's time for me to slit your fucking lighter light the sky up
to seize everything you ever wanted - one moment
but he keeps on forgettin what he wrote down
he's choking now everybody's joking now
the clock's run out time's up over bloah
he's so stagnant that he knows
this this whole rhapsody
he better go capture this moment and hope it don't
my god my tourniquet
return to me salvation
return to me salvation 
the soul's escaping through this hole that it's gaping
a normal life is boring but superstardom's close to post mortem
it only grows harder only grows hotter
he blows us all over these hoes is all on him
coast to coast shows he's know as the globetrotter
da da dum da dum
no more games i'ma change what you call rage
tear this motherfucking roof off like 2 dogs caged
i been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhyming and stepwritin the next cypher
all the pain inside amplified by the fact
that i can't get by with my 9 to 5
cause man these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
baby mama drama's screaming on and
stay in one spot another day of monotony
has gotten me to the point i'm like a snail
so here i go is my shot
feet fail me not cause maybe the only opportunity that i got
my wounds cry for the grave
my soul cries for deliverance
will i be denied christ
tourniquet
my suicide

it's cause i'm doing this man

when a nigger come and when a nigger front gotta give it to him good give a nigger what he wants

but now i'm finally waking up out of the dream and i realise that life is so beautiful
and i aingt gotta put my hand on a nigger unless it's definitely necessary otherwise it's unsuitable
ha going through a lot of different little things that make a nigger want to go and wanna get and wanna bring a couple goons out to handle a couple situations and let em elimination all the bullshit so i can sing
run through every city run through every state
though we get a lot of love i love to get a lot of hate
though the ones who will try to hate will start to love cause it's undeniable that everything i do is great even when i do it wrong imma share it in a song and i'm questioning the words in the end all along
i guess i gotta die first return re - incarnated just to really see any other form
until that time imma sit and shine while i sit here with the grime give me credit when it's mine 'fore i dent it with a 9 millimeter see the sign and the heater then i'm giving all my people get in line now

i have the type of mental state you couldnt comprehend
unusually stupid of you for you to think im your friend
i usually do what i do and suffer no consequence
i offer no mercy the controversy is once again
here's the story of a little boy
growing up in a suburban home
trying to cope with everyday life
who lives in a little house
that was built in the middle of the street
hey mom
tupac's on the juke box
so what he shot two cops
and raped a little girl
while two dudes watched
nuh - uh they were trying to frame him
you wouldn't have two pack shaker
no that aingt how you say his name mum
you're so lame
don't you know anything
i know that you'll probably go
and join in a gang
yeah right i'm out
where's my fucking walkman at
stop cussing at me
shut up bitch
and quit talking black
well
slammed the door and i'm out
now what
it's probably warm in the house
fuck i forgot my jacket
forgot it was winter
i'm getting thinner
i'm hungry
is mom cooking dinner
mom
let me back in
i forgot my coat
mom come on i'm not playing
it's cold
alright sorry
i need a jacket
mom look
my tupac tape
i just cracked it
ma please let me back in
it is two pack shaker
i just asked him
i'm freezing 
i'm sneezing
i'm breathing too much cold air
i'm wheezing
i aingt did nothing
i didnt say i'm leaving
i said i'm going on the front porch to get something
alright here
take your damn coat and leave
fine i'll leave
mom you cut off the sleeves
our house
in the middle of the street
one two three
my teacher's two faced
she went to lower my school grades
since last tuesday
i had a toothache
from kool - aid
so mom kicked me out 
and all i had in my suitcase
was one shoelace
a tube sock
and a tube of toothpaste
sometimes
it was cool
cause i could go to a friend's
crash there
fool around and just skip school
but other times
i'd rather just be home
in my own room alone
beat my shit and nobody would know
my little brother sucked on a bottle
'til he was six
so i'd hide it inside the couch
and say i don't know where it is
but as soon as mom found it
i would either be grounded
or kicked out the house
a thousand weeks
and still counting
even when i was underage
mom was telling cops
i was trying to run away
i told her
someday bitch you're gonna pay
please mom please mom please mom
i wanna stay 
my brother's incoherint
mom's a single parent
who aingt caring
staring through me
like i'm transparent
made it clear
that i was just there
to run an errands
told her friends
i was a son from her last marriage
sent me up to the little corner store
with a little note
please sell my step - son
some cigarettes so i can smoke
one time
i tried to fake sick
to get attention
back - fired
mom sent me to school
with a vengence
my life's the worst thing that could ever happen to me
i go to class
and every teacher's always laughing at me
and mom says white rappers are laughed at
not only that
she heard me upstairs
i can't rap
and i'm stupid
i never make an average
of a b+
i need to sit on my ass and sue people
like she does
one time i got food poison
from a hot dog
mom sued and got 2000
from ballpark
hey ma you got a dollar
i don't think so
now keep an eye on your brother
i'm going to bingo
but mom you said you were broke
who said
you got your ears messed up
from that damn rap music
i am phenomenal
with every ounce of my blood
with every breath in my lungs
won't stop until i'm phe - no - menal
however long that it takes
i'll go to whatever lengths
it's gonna make me a monster though
but i would never say oh its impossible
cause i'm born to be phenomenal
unstoppable unpoppable thought bubbles
untoppable thoughts fucking juggernaut that'll
stomp you in the verse obstacles i'm drawn to 'em
when the going got rough
some of what i done fought through was the worst little sissy
who the fuck taught you how to persevere
there aingt no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
the messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
yeah i don't try like hell then i might as well
hang it up like a shelf gotta keep growing with it evolve
cause you can keep throwing shit at the wall
but you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
time to slip in that zone till' i find myself
inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
into waters where nobody else has gone before
or willing to go uncharted feeling is so
bomb i'm feeling myself i'm a giant
sometimes i gotta remind myself that i am
let me self - empower you
when you're down and they're trying to clown the fuck out of you
and you feel like you're running out of fuel
i'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
convert it to gunpowder too
now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
put the spark to it like martha stewart barbecuing
ah screw it feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
punch through it just cock back put your all into it
now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
never take back what you say
if you stay strapped in your brain engaged in a steel cage match
ready to scrap asap
take your fists and just ball it
show who's big and who's smallest you're christopher wallace
now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
lays flat where you put your dinner plates at
and set it on 'em like a placemat
and i want you to say that
step into the unknown and find yourself
you're floating freely no emotion
got a fuckin mouth with no shut - off valve
can't even cut off power to it but it's what allowed
me to come up out from under the fucking ground
cause i worked my butt off now
it's a subject that i don't know how to shut up about
cause i stuck it out
like a motherfucking tongue thats how i responded when i got shoved around
you're gonna have non - believers
but when you're beyond belief you probably shouldn't wonder how
get it how you live
but are you prepared to give more than you get
and put in twice what you get back from this shit
though what you sacrifice barely is half never give
rap is my shiv
but it's like my shield at the same time i wield and my knife is will
sometimes i feel just like b real from cypress hill
how i can just kill a cypher survivor's guilt
i rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
ready to face any challenge waiting
can taste it it's salivation i'm waging retaliation
look what i have built reputation is validation
the only thing i'm capable of making is amazing
only thing you're capable of making is a false statement
or accusation i am legendary status in fact
that is the only way you'll ever be able to say
your legend is making an allegation
i write with the left same hand i hold the mic with
as i fight to the death 'til my last breath
managed to prove who the best man is
prevail at all costs be the only ones left standing
in the end but i aingt gonna be the only one with the advantage
of knowing what it's like to be southpaw
cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
cause i am
yo i dedicate to this to yo
to all my fans keepin y'all in health
let's tell this whitey ford to go fuck himself
cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart conditionin

all i need's a line but sometimes i don't always find the words to rhyme
to express how i'm really feeling at that time yes

it's just sometimes it's always me
how dark can these hallways be
the clock strikes midnight
1 2 then half past 3

you look like you're in another world
but i can read your mind
how can you be so far away
lying by my side 
things aingt always what they seem or cracked up to be 
like all these faking ass rappers in this industry 
talking bout what they got and they aingt got a damn thang 
how you own three cars but you don't own ya own name 
get ya business right boys the first class is in session 
get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession 
start up ya own company trademark the name 
that's gon' run ya bout a grand so start saving ya change 
open a bank account quick and then follow these steps 
sign yourself to yourself and start signing ya own checks 
hit the booth and start recording at the speed of need 
whatever gets ya juices flowing could be speed or weed 
get it mixed and mastered pressed up and plastered 
sell it to ya whole hood out the trunk ya bastard 
show all the non - believers what you destined to be 
and in just a couple years you could be rich like me 
money to be made best believe a nigga clockin
i run it myself like a quarterback option
i pitch a 10 g's tell a bitch to go shopping
she buy herself some clothes and she bought me back a chopper
see niggas tryna kick it but no i don't play sucka
i'm all about my cake i'm tryna marry betty crocker
a package on the way you know my whip game proper
and enough for one key i see seventy thousand dollas
now i was shootin dice smokin on a joint
i bet with yo gotti he hit five straight points
we ovahere hustlin we ova here grindin
you rap about money and nigga might sign ya
you rap about me and a nigga might find ya
banana in ya ass with ya head right behind ya
dope game bitch let his mamma worry bout him you can holla at me for a fee
lying by my side
my name is kxng crooked i snap on you rappers often
when i'm spazzing i'm just getting my passionate point across
like a hood cat clapping his hands when he's talking
now that i got your attention i feel i should really mention
don't come around here flossing big willies we'll willie lynch 'em
pull out the chopper rappers hitting the ground
like every bar is a bullet when i pull it it sound like
b - b - b - b - b a couple of bullets are coming your way then it jam
like god damn
then i pick up something quicker start killing everything in the vicinity
the proximity the glocksimity we on yosemite sam
bam bam your body drop van damme karate chop
the beretta's a better competitor
pop pop turn your sweater to a crop top
killing you and whoever in that drop top
etcetera etcetera and it will not stop
just shoot shoot like doot doot
and beaucoup beaucoup i'm cuckoo
i'm a star going to war with you clones like count dooku
i'm worlds apart from you rappers
like i walk in the booth rocking a biosuit made of plastic
and nasa's galactic elastic traveling through space interstellar rapping
broadcasting from uninhibited planets
when i come back that's it
you see a flash in the sky it's that nigga i
when i land you wack niggas die
and your casket is your last hit
you wack bitch fucking bastard
back to the hand clapping
you die quicker than darren wilson walking through ferguson
dressed like the grand dragon of the klan
passing niggas with pants sagging
with their hand on a black magnum
to clap him backwards
so their last words is kcuf meht nmad saggin
that's backwards for fuck them damn niggas
buck them damn triggers
charge us bodies fill up them damn rivers
cause everybody wanna be the best rapper alive
but i only like dead rappers
compare me to the best rappers who died
and you rappers i used to look up to
i gotta cancel you now
like simon cowell i can't let you ex factors survive
nah the time's right and they finally limelighting the god of this rhyme writing
my mic can only be likened to poseidon's trident and zeus' lighting strike
and my metaphors are what thor was to the norse viking
i'm a born titan and at - point kill 'em like swordfighting
i'm slicing organs with songwriting i dwarf giants
i hope i'm rubbing you pussies wrong sort of like poor dyking
i smoke philosophy i snort science
that means i'm higher than higher learning look in my eyes
that's where the fire's burning
try to deny music's messiah returning
you die and you fry in my iron furnace
i am on my get rich or die trying like when em was signing curtis
cause i am murderous
now we can do this a couple of different ways it really depends
could give them classic ny jeans over the timbs
or i could spit about my car and how it sit on the rims
i could tell you why i'm hot and disappear like mims
but the bars there put that on god ask an atheist
and if i aingt the bomb at least i'm in the blast radius
i'm beating these kids' indictment shit i like the terror
apb on my actions i'm in the viking era
moment of truth i give you facts right now
fuck this cypher my mind aingt on rap right now
so it's fuck metaphors and punches all the witty shit
got a missing uncle and another need a kidney flip
face says i been stressed
i got an aunt getting her ass kicked by ms
nigga why am i here for the look for the promo
shit that bothered from the start
cause the cancer left his lungs and it's on my grandfather's heart
yeah just not the side that the beat is on
i'm supposed to put that to the side when the beat is on
i'm planning the funeral i'm getting the hearse ready
these niggas only wanna ask me if the verse is ready
not a how do i feel not a how do i deal
if that's the life nigga then how is it real
these last couple of days i've been speaking to my peers
giving them cries for help i guess they need to see the tears
but wait wildest part of all of that is

but fuck it gotta pardon 'em shout out to my squad and 'em
house gang shady i'm gone nigga my job is done
yelawolf gadsden alabama

i'm 33 i've got 3 kids and i just popped 3 pills
i don't know which one's which or what it's for
safety aingt really a habit i've formed
i still smoke to the cigarette butt
i still drink till i end up being that klutz
clumsy self - destructive dummy
stumbling over my words mumbling
i'll probably do it tonight
leave the bar leave the car
and pass out like a fetus in a jar with my feet up to the stars
and dream about that light that leads up to the lord
i have nightmares about my momma getting beat up in the yard
wake up feeling like half a human
hit the studio and unleash this guilt and regret
for my lack of union between rap you and the rock and roll community
for unity between country music and mcs i'm claiming immunity
still i'm working sawing milling this tree
building this house exactly the way charlemagne the god and lord jamar thought it would be
wait a minute the lord and the god hate me
jesus christ i am the white devil
nah
i'm still working sawing milling this tree
building this house exactly the way i thought it should be
wanna take a tour let's see
i've got floor - to - ceiling windows and a cabin - style mansion
bucks bears trucks boats tires spares four - wheelers
three - wheelers two - wheelers a drug dealer on call
plaques on the wall racks on the wall for my guns on the wall
lift kits low riders chop shops hi tops low tops cowboy boots
dixie flags american flags slumerican tags on my slumerican ass
ceo
i've got my name on the bathrobe and the flame on the back porch is lit
guess who's coming to dinner
andre 3000 and hank the third go figure
i've got two stand - up jetskis a top pedigree horse just to pet and feed of course
who rides a horse in nashville i might
i've got bicycles for the kids tricycles for the babies
m - 80s bottle rockets bottles in my pocket
moonshine gold watches gold rings
all fake no bling don't hate that's my thing
i've got new clothes old clothes vintage tremendous endless style
goodwill loves me mackle - more than you
i've got flat screen tvs with skate videos on repeat
all the latest cds mp3s and beats by dre
thank you very much jimmy iovine for the check
i've got a black woman fine as she can be
fefe with a ring on her finger that could give sight to the blind
a 5 a 10 a couple hundreds laying on the counter
i don't know where that came from
i got artwork from hard work yardworkers for yard work
don't look under the tarp sir
i'm growing weed for my mama there
i've got a paved driveway and photos in the hallway of me on my harley
and i did it my way
see hip hop is what you make of it
and i'm making a lot of it
see that's a quadruple entendre jay z eat your heart out
but these cyphers i treat 'em like a war don't want no mediators
nah this that grow up in the p's behavior next door to the greasy neighbors
people thank you i do this for all the mean creators
i was someone who never needed favors to get where i'm at
now they deem me a savior
but to be honest i aingt feeling like that man i just really like rap
y'all lucky trust me
i'm opposite the hands of sandusky
with the shit that my pen state these rappers can't touch me
ugly shit you serious i'm hideous
i was better than all you silly kids while trying to figure out who i really is
as a younger dude life was something rude
i barely made it to the first like a cutler move
no rubber groove on my shoes had to fight so suspensions
i had 3 in one week yeah that was public school
did i say 3 in 1 that's funny cause there's 4 of us in the slaughter
that's a 3 and 1 i learned that in public school too
like what's in between a 3 and 1 and house gang i spoke to all 3 on 1 call
like i dropped 2 albums and 3 is 1 second from being done
just need y'all 3 to send me 1 verse apiece
for this heatmakerz beat and brother's keeper 1
simple mathematics i'm adding up to all these rap addicts
i don't like to divide dough so i multiply flow
and subtract maggots
like a brand new craftmatic boy i'm back at it
smoking these new boys like my last habit
dabnabbit i tried to quit but everything i kick's like the last dragon
hoes sucking my drummer dick they on my bandwagon
i just gotta laugh cause y'all pushing a lot of swag
i'm pushing this big ole hearse don't get body bagged
these new rappers be asking me
why i don't be hanging out where they be hanging out
i tell 'em i say lil nigga listen here
if i don't got no business there i don't got no business there
see there's a difference here
you hustling so you can be seen
nigga i'm grinding so i can disappear
i don't do it like other rappers do
when it's on time it's skull and bone signs at the stu
we got guns you only find on your cheat code screen
if you think i remind you of any of these niggas you wilding out
like chico bean
when there's drama i don't ask no questions i just clap in that direction
i look at this gat like it's an actual accessory
i'm anti - social so relax when you step to me
nigga i shoot the breeze with actual weaponry
your lil' stare downs won't fare well
i got a pale conscience i'm the grey area
last person i had a bond with was a bail bondsman
now imagine me hanging with y'all and we rapping on the same song
nigga i'd rather juggle a couple of chainsaws
or run through hell with a pair of gasoline hanes on
i'm a star but not on some i wanna be a star kinda shit
the only celebrity that give a fuck less than me is marshawn lynch
glock in the stash as a backup but the mac'll burst
cripple your style your first born child'll come out
with a colostomy bag as the afterbirth
i don't give a fuck
nigga i'll show up to beyonce's show posing as jay z
stagger in your studio session with a bomb strapped to my chest
looking like omarion holding his baby
jump in the 4 door mercedes with a 44 listening to jojo and k - ci
drinking and sniffing enough blow that it got me thinking i can exchange sicknesses
maybe this ebola for rabies
that's it just living the rapper life
banana clip in the air looking like it's 'bout to start singing it's mac tonight
macs i use this mac as a component for thugs rolling up
i got this mac on and you better stay in that corner
cause shit can turn into that song except i don't give a fuck what day it is
i'll have this club going up fuck with me
mack magnet attracting enormous green
slap this clip in this gat then call this arm christy mack
cause this bitch is that war machine
life of a giant but who needs size when you're wack and your team's soft
drag your girl down this hill 'til she admits that it feels like she's jacking the beanstalk
we both got marketing plans
yours is to sell records and try to net more than you gross before
mine is to punch you in your face if you ever disrespect me
and then go invest into a grocery store
rolled up with the smith & wesson and drew on you like let's fight now
i do numbers i turn you and your crew into two plumbers
translation get your shit together and pipe down
fuck a mic i don't write i chew and spit
i'll shoot you and your sis if you insist
i got my eyes on the sparrow
silencer's so big it look like i got bobby shmurda tied to the front of the barrel
and he doing this
i just turned slaughterhouse to a quintet
began to trend - set murdered a friend's pet
made shit as ill as it can get went in depth
like a fucking vignette and two bars skins wet
i'm already covered in sweat and i wasn't even ready to come in yet
ahh let me set this drink down
beat up a gal start beef with her pal
probably be wild 'til i'm wrinkled and senile
and rap god was a freestyle
off the top of the dome piece while i was sleep on the couch
and i'm freestyling now
i need a towel sweat leaks from my brow
it's burning my eyes my cerebral is foul
cause shit i'm thinking about should be illegal
i need my head banned like the guy who left cleveland ohio
and went to south beach with his talents
scream fuck you on the way out and wink with a smile
this whole game can eat a dick i'm going back deep underground
but right now i'm back on that bullshit and you i'm singling out
cause you're so fucking outdated you should mingle a while
what the fuck is this klusterfuk of busters
bunch of buster douglas' motherfuckers is one hit wonders
one swing and you're crowned
knocked one out the park one catchy jingle and now
you think you fucking with me cause you sold like 300 thou
bitch i can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground
reach up swing from a cloud with 3 thousand people around
evil and vile enough to leap in the crowd
and heave a child in a sink hole on cinco de mayo
when i'm sprinkled in pico de gallo
mardi gras beads in a towel
i just made that up
i don't know much spanish i'm not bilingual
but i'll show you a mexican stand off
between just these two amigos
cause neither really wants to say what we're thinking out loud
but i sure as fuck think i know how read body english no doubt
cause we're trying to kill each other but lyrically
the fuck is humility what is a real emcee
royce he came up in the shit with me
never spit that hustler shit it wasn't a fit for me
let them adjust 'til they just get the gist of me
just not giving a fuck and plus with the history
of muscular distrophy it wasn't a mystery
why this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning
so what in the fuck is a list to me
i'm used to not being on it i expect it out 'em
heck wit' em i get my respect without 'em
aingt really been into diamonds since i put my first record out
but i could put a chain around my second album
and wear it as a neck medallion
became a millionaire went downhill from there
became civil office swivel chair sterling silverware
screaming life is still unfair til i get a real career
the fuck am i gonna do until then this job is too fulfilling
two ga - jillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in
and a mood to kill till i plow my coupe de ville
into some children at the food pavilion and build - a - bear
warrior's mind im pro - hydrocodone euphoria
in the drug emporium line i'm soaring
i'm pouring vicodin four at the time ignoring the warning signs on 'em fore i go four wheeler riding
gory and violent and horrifying
you surely won't find no one more appalling
than i am with this retaliatorial rhyming for gloria steinem
but i finger her like a witness show me a line - up
i usually am abusive but excuse me ma'am
i guess i must've threw you for a loop like toucan sam
when i said i could use the sample cause you's a tramp
but look how you react to this trigger like
when i call you a bigger dyke than the hoover dam
you're playing right in lex luthor's hand
it's such a ruthless plan might even lose a fan
but fuck it superman wouldn't change in a phone booth for stan
i'm a brand new being like grand puba's band
happy as anderson cooper having a tuba crammed
in his pooper with lubricantwait that's too i can't
since honesty is the best policy i'll give you the old college try
try to acknowledge my mistakes probably won't qualify
as a gentleman and a scholar but it's time that i swallow pride
and say that i'm sorry sorry i can't apologize
i think of all them times i compromised my bottom lines
and thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughter's minds
then i'm like dollar signs
but i may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke
is more of a knockout than janay rice
play nice bitch i'll punch lana del rey right
in the face twice like ray rice in broad daylight
in plain sight of the elevator surveillance
til her head is banged on the railing
then celebrate with the ravens
never date an assailant who self - medicates with inhalants
i'd meditate but i may need a better way to escape
the aggression rage and the anger
cause they restraints on the ankles
heavyweights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains
this aingt enough to contain it
but i still get the same respect as jay if i came on
stage in a fucking negligee everyday and liz claiborne
devastated from breakup with kate hudson
wait slut your friends what are they gonna say
cause makeup aingt gonna cover
that eye that's seven - eighths of the way shut
peppersprayed with your face cut
made my bank like a lay up
off these effing skanks on the way up
oh bitch thinks she's heaven - sent
it's evident that she aingt never been with seven inches
yes i said seven i measured it
seven inches from the floor
while i'm standing on the fourth floor balcony
at the sheradon when i'm stretching it
bitch i'm a pimp so a limp dick is all you'll ever get
so if she's hesitant to get the hint
i'll bet you that i get the message sent who she's messing with
hella quick when i tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon
when i step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench
existential detriments to a lesbian devil
in the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level
that separatists like a chechnian rebel
impressionist with a pencil
a pessimist with his lips pressed against
the edge of this red bull
pedal to the metal i'm ripping this shit cause right away i'll give it to a bitch like a pedestrian deadly as ever
you see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when i push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass
shadyxv as perplexing as
the last fifteen years and i'm predicting my next relapse
when i spit these lyrics so don't look at me weird
when i start shifting gears and shit re - smears all over britney spears
and these little disney queers
who use chicks for beards
just made that up too
oh and the shady 20
we wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the super bowls
cause it's supposed to confuse you hoes
the flows lose you as usual so juvenile
2 year old when i go to the studio
it's only music but don't be foolish though
you don't know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though
in my homie's buick
been known to lose it though so if i overdo it you drove me to it
when i step in the vocal booth like i'm supposed to do
and i murder you on a fucking track like tony stewart
in one take if i fuck up and i don't redo it
you couldn't sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it
the day i don't say fuck you all you can throw me through it
rootinest - tootinest shooting this from the hip
with the sentiments eminem isn't penning them for the women
i'm an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot
but they consider me equivalent to chlamydia
they tryna get rid of me gadzooks
but i stiggity stand for the fliggity flag
of the united states and the freedom i distribute these raps through
and if i catch you doing anything
hindering or prohibiting that after i give me that
tattoo of your lips on my ass i'mma be literally
picking up and deliberately whipping the statue of liberty at you wooooh
got it somewhere in there probably
psst hey listen 
lalalalala i love my job whoo makes me feel like superman
can you fly i can wanna see 
i'm only entertaining you 
my goal is to stimulate making you high 
and take you and i 
to a place you can't see 
but i believe you can fly 
i don't mean nobody harm i'm just partying 
i'm not your dad not your mom not your guardian 
just a man who's on the mic 
so let me entertain you 
my lyrical content is constantly under fire 
no wonder why i constantly bomb back 
to combat attacks with constant concepts 
when lyrics are constantly took outta context 
failure to communicate with congress has 
been a problem for the longest i guess 
but maybe one day we can make some progress 
food for thought  -  see how long it takes to digest 
feeling good when i should be ashamed 
sh*t i really should've fell but i stood 
see i came like a flame in the night 
like a ghost in the dark; there's a ray there's a light 
there's a hope there's a spark 
but when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye 
until they decide to set their differences aside 
and this is why only one of us will survive 
so children follow my lead and feel the vibe cause 
my music can be slightly amusing 
you shouldn't take lyrics so serious it might be confusing 
just trying to seperate the truth from entertainment 
it's stupid aingt it i get sick of trying to explain it 
see i could sit and argue with you but it goes beyond 
just being a snot pointy - nosed bleach - blond 
cause i came here to uplift; let your woes be gone 
tell 'em to get fu*ked and just mosie on 
constantly moving constantly using the constitution 
as a form of restitution 
bless the children nothing less than brilliant 
let me entertain you like robbie williams 
i'll be here when y'all are gone rebuilding 
world revolving still evolving still slim 
how many kids'll copy probably millions 
but i'ma do this as a fu*king hobby till then cause 
my lyrical content contains subject matter 
that sucks up all these fu*ked up young kids 
at an alarming rate; common denominate 
add it up and you'll see just why i dominate 
i try to stimulate but kids emulate 
and mimmick every move you make  -  slim you great 
but wait can't you see i'm only here to entertain 
i gotta be the one to go against the grain 
cause man i see it feel it live it but it's inhumane 
for me to see you be influenced but pretend you aingt 
but they don't understand that i've been through pain 
if you get to know me i could be a friend you gain 
but you can't just stand there and try to judge 
it hurts but you're jealousy probably tears you up inside as much 
and it's such a pleasure every button that i touch 
i treasure every glutton that i punish in my lust but 
slim
bitch you make me hurl 
straight from the hip cut to the chase i tell a muthafucking slut to her face
saturday through sunday monday monday through sunday yo'
till then just sit your drunk ass on that fucking runway ho'
cause i can't be your superman 
can't be your superman 
your superman your superman 
yeah we fucked bitch so what that's about as far as your buddy goes
you don't want that neither do i i don't want to flip when i see you with guys
cause i know you want me baby i think i want you too 
i think i love you baby i think i love you too 
i'm here to save you girl come be in shady's world 
you know you want me baby you know i want you too 
they call me superman i'm here to rescue you 
i want to save you girl come be in shady's world 
ooooh boy you drive me crazy bitch you make me hurl 
hallie jade i love that name love that tattoo what's that say
that's ammo for my arsenal i'll slap you off that barstool
there goes another lawsuit leave handprints all across you
put anthrax on a tampax and slap you till you can't stand
cry me a river oh 
cry me a river 
let's take them back to the future 
bars like paul rosenberg
the small frozen turd 
alright look i had class i just got expelled
i excelled at nothing in school
so if you're tryna test my patience it just failed
but king mathers i still get hailed
so call me sire like i exhaled
after i had a deep ass breath held
i guess well that'll make my size double xl
so kiss your highness's hinded ass
while i'm trying to stretch it's time to exercise
i'm flexing isometrics
twice the reps 'til i get extra - sized
and set my bis and pecs and triceps on fire
cause i'm coming out guns blazing
like flaming pythons my suggestion is parental discretion
be advised due to this mental aggression
we advise you to back up like byron leftwich
i'm infectious i rhyme like i got a sinus infection
a virus i'm congested and i just ingested
five allegras but the side effects from these anti - depressants they're tryna mess with my mind
i'm a regular hyde and jekyll
white with freckles but i silence hecklers
you might wanna head for the fire exits
i'm coming through like a wrecking ball
you would swear i think highly of miley
and i respect her the way i backhand her
excuse my french montana but i am worried about nutting
god damn it i'm a sexist i drive a lexus
textses out of her mind and i'm in texas
with a chainsaw wait what did i forget this
time oh my machetes getting upset he said
he was ready for me to come get him from inside the shed
it was time he's restless
he wants to make blood shed like a storage unit
but before i do it let me think this through
cause if i behead this bitch then i'd be headless
mic check one two
i aingt barely check the mic just yet
and i just sweared like twice as many times
in less than ninety seconds
than andrew fucking dice ever did in his fucking life
but i guess i'm expected to make these kinds of violent records
it's why i keep rhyming reckless
fuck it i swear like a diamond necklace
since freestyling over phone tap my line's connected
with rhymes that kept in touch with the fans that's why the more bars the better my reception
and i give a fuck about sales and fuck pop i don't even like refreshments
cindy crawford tryna fend me off with a bendy straw
at the waffle house awful mouth
but if you don't like what i'm talking about then block me out
just then foxy brown walks up and knocks me down
kicks me and socks me ow
apparently still mad over what i said last year
on that vegas track i just look stupid and stand there
and try to act like i can't hear
what sorry dear but i think pam grier just stuck a tampon in my damn ear
that's when my man denaun porter ran behind me to pantomime
that if you wanna kick his ass stand in line
hands inside my pants as i fantasize taking advantage
of brandy and janet by grabbing my spanish fly
like a blind hispanic guy with his zipper stuck
give a fuck it's all part of my grand design
to get amanda bynes to come and fucking blow me like a dandelion
better watch your step you 'bout to cross an outlandish mine
i'm what you get if aaron hernandez rhymed
so stand aside unless you plan to find out how handy i am with a branding iron
fuck talking clear so you all can hear
i'd rather rap like a fucking auctioneer
fuck around and walk from here to the southpaw premier
get on paul's back rapping paul revere
so call me queer cause i'm always weird
so praise a genius hope this don't get taken out of text
but hillary i promise to wipe my server clean if you face subpoenas
got a name that speaks for itself like anthony weiner
hands in between my pants in a theater jacking my meat
a fan of trina angelina and christina and serena and selena
scarlett johansson tiffani amber thiessen
give me a damn good reason and not wanna slip an ambien in the cappuccino
and try to have a 3 - sum with janet reno
i'm fucked worse than donald trump
on lexapro in mexico across from a texaco in mcdonald's drunk
broke and out of gas busted water pump
getting fondled up by ronald feeling him on his rump
oh yeah and me and alyssa milano hump
we do
bringing the horror to emcees like the aura of the run dmc fedora
addidas and diadoras but i need at least three to four of those rita oras
in a four seater taurus but tell them my face is the best seat in the house
i'll let them bleed in my mouth while i'm eating them out 
heat seeking missile duck demented sick hate and see who gives a fuck
i invented prick and that's a true statement i see the bitch in you caitlyn
i keep the pistol tucked like bruce jenner's dick
no disrespect though not at all no pun intended that took a lot of balls 
oh and azealia banks just wanna tell you thanks
now i got trailer skanks sending me ballpark franks in the mail as pranks
and hot pockets thanks a lot
awful i made monopoly off misogyny
sodomy how many chocolatey jell - o pops can he possibly lace walking atrocity
no wonder you scoff at me it's still obvious i'm as off - putting as bill cosby is
treat women like property possessive like a noun with an apostrophe
s's i'd probably stalk broccoli yes it's
socrates with a block of cheese and a dollar stuck in this soda pop machine
got emcees dropping to knees copping a plea bargain
they keep sobbing like please stop it
aftermath bitch still detoxing
looking for us we over here
like we're eavesdropping
well jimmy moved in with his mother
cos he aingt go no place to go
and now i'm right back in the gutter
with a garbage bag that's full of clothes
cause you live at home in a trailer
what the hell you gonna do 
cause i live at home in a trailer
mom i'm coming home to you
well my name is jimmy
he's name's greg buehl
me and him and you  -  we went to the same school
this aingt cool i'm in a rage
he's tapping my mom and we're almost the same age
on the microphone i drop bombs
look at this car 'thanks a lot mom'
here and happy birthday rabbit here's a brand new car you can have it a 1928 delta
this shit won't even get me to the shelter
and i can't even say i'm from mowtown
cause i'm back in the 810 now
cos i live at home in a trailer
it's not about lyrics anymore it's about a hot beat and a catchy hook
if we gotta dumb down our style and abc it
then so be it
cause nowadays these kids jeez
don't give a shit about lyrics
all they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
long as they can go to the club and get blitz
pick up some chicks and get some digits
and the dj's playing them hits
oh this my jam this my shit
we don't know a word to a verse
all we know is the chorus
'cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
and the songs ginormous the whole formula's switched
'cause we don't know anymore what are hits
is it the beat is it the rap
is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap
and how do we adapt and get trl votes
when 13 year olds control the remote
and ashley's got a brand new nose
we gotta put some new emphasis on our syllables
if the emphasis on the compact disc isn't the beat
than i'm gonna feature em and get rich
and let dre mix the shit and drive off in the range ro
'cause everywhere i go they love the bling bling flow
bang bang look at the way my chain glow
the ring on my fing' cost jermaine a lot of dough oh
the fuck am i busting my brain for
it's just the way the game go oh it takes 2 to tango
you call this a lame flow
you bought the shit
i guess you to blame too
i just found the angle
no more reality flow
i'm tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
cock the mac 11 in front of hot 97
and call my publicist tell her we're in press heaven
no one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the internet
so you want the chat room or the house of malibu em
your emphasis is on the wrong syllable
they said 30's the new 20
funny must mean 40's the new 30
interesting 'cause ever since then it's been innocence
an extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
of the shit coming out right now
it's all trash
the torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
jay said it's his last and 50 and em
then what detox drops what we got then
so now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do
gambling everytime we put a record out
just looking for that hook
shorty i love you
and you love me too
we were meant to be 'cause shorty
you love me
and i love you too
and i promise i'll be true to you
go shorty it's your birthday
you made it just in time to hear my wordplay
it's the kid that flip flows who used to flip o's
and run g for days used to see how i get hoes
i'm international i get my dick licked round the globe
i'm sick right into shows riding on lolo's
puffing on coco my bitch in manolo's
don't fuck with the dodo's that's slang for dumb hoes
i playing i aingt got time to joke joke
you fuck around you could get your ass smoked lock
it's not a game me b i aingt playing
beat behind me playing so you aingt hear anyway
you don't hear what i'm saying
me fin - nini - na
fee - fi - dididee - yay
just give me my check and i'll be on my way
sunny bunny money and funny
you aingt even listening and i just took your money
there once was a time everywhere he turned
shady aftermath was all you heard
but they say 50 sang too much
and em got soft
and they say dre just fell the fuck off
well fuck the fuck offs
all y'all eat salt be mad we bad fresh up outta the vault oh
new syllables eat ball you fucks off's
your house your bitch i'm getting sucked off
east south midwest even up north
falling victim to wax spitting bring out the white chalk
all for the gingerbread we get it and get lost
catch me if you can i'm running past while y'all walk
shady made me for bringing it back
for the history of rap
it's gone with a snap a sneer and a clap
what happened to just spitting about living in the motherfucking city you at
in the grimiest condition i breath in drama
king mathers and cash me that's freak karma
i'm everything anything you could never be
it's a hitting rhyme in the month deep
i speak with a piece no peace on my mind
i repeat every evil deed done of mine
no rest contest contract to sign

sometimes you just feel tired feel weak
when you feel weak you feel like you just wanna just give up
but you gotta search within you try and find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation not to give up
and not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face
till i collapse i'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
till the day that i drop you'll never say that i'm not killing 'em
cause when i am not then i'm a stop pinning 'em and
i am not hip - hop and i'm just not eminem
subliminal thoughts when i'm a stop sending

is it a miracle
or am i just a product of pop fizzing up
fa shizzel my wizzel this is the plot
listen up
you bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a fuck
till the roof comes off
till the lights go out
till my legs give out
can't shut my mouth
till the smoke clears out
and my high burn out
i'm a rip this shit till my bones collapse
am i high perhaps
music is like magic there's a certain feeling
you get when you're real and you spit and people are feeling ya shit
this is your moment
and every single minute you get try'n hold on to it
so while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over
just admit when it's at it's end
'cause i'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
i got a list
here's the order of my list that it's in  - 
it goes reggie jay - z tupac 
where my thugs at
huh increase the doses bustin whoever closest
thug livin hell or prison never losin my focus
i'm makin money moves manditory
in a discussion my past records tell a story
picture niggaz we rushin and still bustin
til the cops come runnin duck in abandoned buildings
ditchin my gun homeboy the motherfuckin villain
i live the lifestyles of drug dealers but now legit list
so i laugh til i cry when the law come get me
no baby momma drama nigga miss me why plant seeds
in a dirty bitch waitin to trick me not the life for me
livin carefree til i'm buried  -  and if they dare me
i'm bustin on niggaz until they scurry i'm clearly
a man of military means in my artillery
watchin over me through every murder scene
from adolescence to my early teens thought we was gonna die
sellin dope to all the fiends at times i wanna cry
and still we try to change the past in vain
never knowin if this game'll last feelin ashamed
of cocaine the product of the devil am i sellin my soul
got tired of small time livin niggaz tellin me no
i got mine fuck them other suckers that's the mentality
jealous - ass bustaz 
i know you niggas been waiting for this shit for a long time
well here it is nigga here it is
no insanity plea for me i ride the beef til i burn
sensimilla bar your kids from the lessons i learned
and in turn i'm hostile guess you could call me anti - social
niggaz shakin like they caught the holy ghost when i approach em
try to politic before i smoke em like sun zu
niggaz do unto these snitches before it's done to you
and if the cops come arrest me in the evening
best believe they comin for my dogs in the mornin
and if i die by a slug the death of a true thug
tell me will my niggaz mourn me gettin blowed out
high watch me murder the bird before he testify
strikes walkin close to my third i live a trouble life
and if you dream be a part of my team
from long beach to queens drug dealers to ex - fiends
keep yo' eyes on the prize nigga watch for bustaz
soon as a verse starts i eat at an mcs heart what is he thinking
about to go against me smart
i'll probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but i'll never be served my
spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth
that would be the death of me first
'cause in my heart of hearts i know nothing could
ever be worse that's why i'm
clever when i put together every verse
my thoughts are sporadic i act like
i'm an addict
i rap like i'm addicted to smack
like i'm kim mathers
but i don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
so this is like a full blown attack i'm launching
at them the track is on some
battling rap who wants some static
'cause i don't really think that the fact that
i'm slim matters
a plaque and platinum status is wack if i'm not the baddest
until the roof 
the roof comes off 
until my legs 
i i will not fall
feels like no one can
beat me

things done changed but it's alright
remember they used to thump but now they blast right

custom designed for instrumental

uhh pop the clutch let the cold crush rush

beefin without skills seekin will only weaken
the artist speakin over beats and you be cheatin
cacaphony of small talent rappers claimin a coast
over instrumentals aingt got no real street credentials
here come the philosopher hip - hopppin ya correctly
ignorant ass mc's continue to tempt me

too many mc's rappin causin lyrical gridlock
lyrical syllables interlock in my voicebox
yet i'm still unknown like the x on sadat

kill that noise 
now when i bomb like sadaam the world feels the wrath of khan
desert storm in this modern day babylon
i be the twelve disciples strap arms
all black on running your spot hit the safe and i'm gone
like a thief wrong i keep the long 38 warm
silent and calm and blackout when the beef is on
focus on your rap holsters notice
i'm evil like the exorcist to the locusts
ferocious thoughts are mergin at night
like jehovah towards the virgin in white
i'm wrapped in a turban for spite
like a israelite snatchin hoes up my flow's up
when the fuckin world blows up throw your hands up
it's a holdup frontin like you down for the real
to make a meal but when plan fold nigga you squeal

this is for the millionaires
throw a stack in the air and watch brothers start plotting
honeys start to stare
'cause game is money and money is game
and broke brothers make the 45 flame with no shame
now many people die over these dead green guys
ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise
it's the root of all evil and sins
yet and still it makes the world go around
like my 20 - inch rims

platinum plaques cover my walls
grinding diamonds shining and without one flaw
get the cash the grass the ass will bounce
luciano and all amounts that's all that counts 'cause

to make us go through such pains & heartache 
but still i know 
that my love is so strong for you

some niggas say that nigga where is gone
but i'm low in the cut and gotta microphone

you motherfuckin clone get off that nigga's style and get'cha own
it's miscellane and it's on again
for the niggas that slept they shoulda stayed in step
and kept ya big fuckin mouth shut 
i woke up with a stomach ache headache back ache
advil tylenol peptol slept so long realised my world is wrong
my world is gone like disco
blowin up cisco and in my cammo
standin in back of me was my soul
thinking of the easiest way to get a bank roll
knowledge is urban - able exhaust manifold
a tar can of hos to lubricate my system quick
shaky bitches off the dick
cos she got a vice grip on the flow from my lips
i'm slow but equipped with the proper tools
show me the one talkin shit so i can drop a fool
i'm out to glow a nigga roll if he think he mr cream
come back on the scene and smoke a phillie g
i really dream of gettin mine now let me tell you what's silly

i heard a gun bustin shots  down the block 
i guess a nigga gettin what he got 
shit is heavy like a medicine ball and broke niggas to smoke niggas
i'll fuck one for y'all they made ya last phone call
to a trick that didn't even care
cos she was gettin fucked somewhere you're stuck in there
now you wanna bust nigga now you wanna kill nigga 
nigga how ya feel 
you can't try to be real 
shit is for real 
i'm cooler than most but i got the shorter temper
and i'm cooler than foes that don't know how it goes
let's take it back to the first side
when you was a new jack and jockin my new track
but you was wrong didn't know about the big long
head - strong nicknamed dav from off the school yard
witta teenage group i'm turnin loots to tracks

when me and my crew came bustin through
all sorts of blushins brew

things just aingt the same for gangstas
times is changing young niggas is aging
becoming old gees in the game and changing
to make way for these new names and faces but
the strangest things can happen from rappin when
niggas get wrapped up in image and acting
niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
zipped up in bags when it happens that's it
i've seen 'em come; i've watched 'em go
watched 'em rise witnessed it and watched 'em blow
watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
best friends and money: i lost them both
went visited niggas in the hospital
it's all the same shit all across the globe
i just sit back and watch the show 
everywhere that i go
aingt the same as befo' 
people i used to know
just don't know me no more 
but everywhere that i go
i got people i know 
who got people they know
so i suggest you lay low 
i moved out of the hood for good you blame me
niggas aim mainly at niggas they can't be
but niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
i'm out of sight now i'm out of they dang reach
how would you feel if niggas wanted you killed
you'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
and choose a new spot if niggas wanted you shot
i aingt a thug how much tupac in you you got
i aingt no bitch neither
it's either my life or your life
and i aingt leaving i like breathing
nigga we can go round for round
clip for clip shit fo' - pound for pound
nigga if you really want to take it there we can
just remember that you fucking with a family man
i got a lot more to lose than you remember that
when you wanna come and fill these shoes 
cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
they wanna hang us see us dead enslave us
keep us trapped in the same place we're raised in
then they wonder why we act so outrageous
run around stressed out and pull out gauges
cause everytime you let the animal out cages
it's dangerous to people who look like strangers
but now we got a new era of gangstas
hustlers and youngsters living amongst us
lookin at us now calling us busters
can't help but reminisce back when it was us
nigga we started this gangsta shit

 what's the difference between me and you 
back when cube  -  was rollin wit lorenzo in a benzo
i was bangin wit a gang of instrumentals
got the pens and pencils got down to business; but sometimes
the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
but you was a real nigga i could sense it in you
i still remember the window of the car that you went through
that's fucked up but i'll never forget the shit we been through
and i'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
cuz you my nigga doc and eazy i'm still wit you
fuck the beef nigga i miss you and that's just bein real wit you
you see the truth is
everybody wanna know how close me and snoop is
and who i'm still cool wit
then i got these fake - ass niggaz i first drew with
claimin that they non - violent talkin like they *voice sample*
spit venom in interviews speakin on reunions
move units then talk shit and we can do this
until then  -  i aingt even speakin your name
just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same
nigga it aingt that i'm too big to listen to the rumors
it's just that i'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
that's the difference
what's the difference between me and you
you talk a good one  -  but you don't do what you supposed to do
i act on what i feel and never deal wit emotions
i'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin
yo i stay wit it
while you try to perpetrate play wit it
never knew about the next level until dre did it 
i stay committed while you motherfuckers baby - sitted
i smash you critics like a overhand right from riddick
 come and get it shitted on villians by the millions
i be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings
so what the fuck am i supposed to do
i pop bottles and hot hollow - points at each and all of you 
a heartless bastard high and plastered
my style is like the reaction from too much acid  -  never cool down
pass it around if you can't handle it
hang hollywood niggaz by they soul train laminates
what's the difference between me and you 
about five bank accounts three ounces and two vehicles
until my death i'm bangladesh
i suggest you hold yo' breath til aingt none left
yo that's the difference
aight hold up hold up
stop the beat a minute i got somethin to say
dre; i wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin weed is in me
 i don't know if i ever told you this but i love you dawg
i got your motherfuckin back just know this shit
 riiight  slim i don't know if you noticed it
but i've had your back from day one nigga let's blow this bitch
 i mean it dawg you ever need somebody offed  -  who's throat is it
 well if you ever kill that kim bitch i'll show you where the ocean is
well that's cool and i appreciate the offer
but if i do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
i'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
and cruise around wit her for seven hours through california
and have her wavin at people  then drop her off on the corner
at the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her
raw dawg get your arm gnawed off
drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of
fuck blood i wanna see some lungs coughed up
get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up
and they nose and cough snot up mucus in hot water
that's for tryin to talk like the chronic was lost product
that's for even thinkin of havin them thoughts thought up
you better show some respect whenever the doc's brought up
so what's the difference between us we can start at the penis
or we can scream i just don't give a fuck and see who means it
damn girl it is hotter than a motherfucker up in here

it takes half the time to get your life reversed
always tryin to play rambo with they ammo
make a nigga wanna stay in family mode 
bang bang 
late nights is full of led that whistles as it goes by
murder arrives anytime
bullets take flight when the fo' - five ignites
some hearts skip a beat some get blew out and every light
put you in the site of youngsters with automatics
bustin on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non - affiliates
these days gun play is official with green lights on every block
know the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
on every corner cali niggaz are dumpin
you'll be shakin your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
makin death not so foreign to ya
niggaz got rugers and m - 14's with enough 
ammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese
i've learned to stay away from house parties
i've seen too many go and end up absent without leavin
aingt no warm welcomings my eyes have witnessed the bend in on
nights that don't sleep and fireworks until dawn 
now tell me  -  what the fuck is this man
niggaz doin brothers in worse than the klan

the one who puts the g in it who you think put me in it
i'm feelin like my whole world is blinded  -  wonderin why
cryin pourin out my heart pourin out liquor behind it
we fought like brothers somethin we never should do

record company motherfuckers asking me when i'm gonna release
and my homies on my back about me helping them get up off them streets 
and it all falls back on me
sometimes somehow it all falls back on me
no matter where we are no matter what we doing it's on me
if it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be
it's kind of funny how they fall back on me
i used to never get a call back homie
before the money they didn't see me like it's dark and it's all black homie
but now they switching cause the card black homie
it wasn't always that way

and all i hear is my girl in my ear
and this nigga eazy asking for his car back homie

no eat no sleep wasn't nothing to me
can't always be how you want it to be
and i'm the one that they looking up to
fuck they expecting from me
that's just the way it is and how it always was
djing parties in my neighborhood just for the love
dope dealers overtipping and bitches stripping
and any minute niggas start tripping and start shooting shit
on any given day i'm like what the fuck
face down on the pavement with the billy clubs
took that feeling to the studio and cued it up
and now it's fuck the police all up in the club
now it's '91 and snoop dogg came to visit
and was like what up cuz let me show you what this chronic like
couldn't help myself just had to dip into that chronic life
and then that night came in when that nigga knight came in 
this one of those dreams you don't wake up from
then again you don't sleep if you come from where i come from
when the sun shines and they bust nines
don't dial 9 plus 1 - 1
when they run up on your school bus with a two truck you might learn something
fear fear's a powerful thing i mean it's got a lot of firepower if you can figure out a way to wrestle that fear to push you from behind rather than to stand in front of you that's very powerful i always felt that i had to work harder than the next guy just to do as well as the next guy and to do better than the next guy i had to just kill and you know to a certain extent that's still with me in how i work you know i just go in
sitting 'bout a hundred stories up like what the fuck
and i'm just looking at it all
i'll be right here in los angeles
looking like a villain laying low
nothing i can do but pack it all up
going up but shit i feel the love
spotlight on me and i'm feeling so rare tonight
acting a fool and feeling alive
i'm fucking flawless like i live in a vault
only type of living i know
see if it was you you would've killed yourself by now
it takes a special kind of mothafucka to live like this
and they ask me how i do it
mothafucka just take a look around
best believe i'm in the building i hear you mothafuckas talking and all that but uh
no no don't mention me at all

and i know you feeling some type of way about it but uh

but now you mothafuckas crossed the line
kinda pissing me off
all the fans and all the fame and though i gave everything to this game

and it's all in a day's work
work hard
working so hard
24/7 3 - 6 - 5
365 hard work
it's all in a day's work
my whole life all i ever thought about was grinding
even though my surroundings only showed me crime and violence
that was back when a rapper needed guns way more than a stylus
and that was back when i felt like rappers was true mothafucking riders
or even back in the day when i was a fucking youngster
shit i was still saying fuck the police
born and raised in the belly of the beast
i had a dream that we was at peace
but i was so wrong so wrong
y'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias
now reality tv talks about pulpits and choirs
some of these hoes give less than a fuck when they running their life story by us
it's the worst when i'm in a hotel like a hilton sick and tired
some of these housewives way too fucking desperate
these bitches thinking fame first
i can't knock the hustle it's all in a day's work
but that's that shit with potential to make the game worse
shit it's just something about that hollywood curse
they just thirst
hard times
i'm on my grind fuck the part - time
stay ready for war i'm on the front line
i'm getting the feeling like it's all mine

why your name always in these rental records
spending rent money getting that bottle service into your section
you leased your car leased your house leased your spouse
no she leaving if you run outta paper
and might be smashing your neighbor
i know you think you're a star cause followers clicking
guess your ambition is to keep up with social tradition
like sneaker shopping summer you niggas are fucking sickening
cause you'll take your soul out just so you can fit in
cuz fuck wrong with these niggas
these labels always ask me to do a song with these niggas

rolling up trees in the belly of the beast
where the people disagree the upper class hate
middle don't exist the bottom of the beat glad i got my sticks
are you jumping on a fad laying in a ditch
i be stomping down demons stomping down quick come on
the police don't come around these parts
they tell me that we all a bunch of animals
the only time they wanna turn the cameras on
is when we're fucking shit up come on
bullets still ringing blood on the cement
black folks grieving headlines reading
tryna pay it no mind you just living your life
everyone is a witness everyone got opinions
got a son of my own look him right in his eyes
i aingt living in fear but i'm holding him tight
damn why the fuck are they after me
maybe cause i'm a bastard
or maybe cause of the way my hair grow naturally
still tryna figure out why the fuck i'm full of rage
i think i know this is bullshit right around the fifth grade
paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switch blade
nothing but pussy on my mind and some plans of getting paid 
but i'm a product of the system raised on government aid
and i knew just how to react when it was time for that raid 
just a young black man from compton wondering who could save us
and could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us
so many rental cars with bricks i think they probably funded avis
some of us was unbalanced but some us used our talents
not all of us criminals but cops be yelling stay back nigga
we need a little bit of payback
don't treat me like an animal cause all this shit is flammable
don't fuck around cause when it's done it's done
and the old folks tell me it's been going on since back in the day
but that don't make it okay
and the white folks tell me all the looting and the shooting's insane
but you don't know our pain

let's face it you basic boy
for realer
professional winners
doc doc you gotta give us some good news
don't let me find out the bitch in you
don't let me find out the snitch in you
fame and fortune
it's not your forte
fuck the world now
i'm done with foreplay
doctor's orders
go fuck yourself
take two of these
in the morning
overdose
and kill yourself
listen this is my evaluation
this shit over saturated y'all can get evacuated
kids sipping actavis and they aingt even activated
married to the internet stuck in place salivating
aingt nobody graduating
don't nobody love this shit the way i love it
that's why i gotta hate it
everybody out for fame that aingt no exaggeration
damn i'm getting aggravated fuck i'm getting agitated
teachers so underpaid in these fucking schools
the police got our name in all they databases
girls be thirteen acting twenty - two
niggas be forty - four acting half they ages
somebody tell me what the fuck is going on
these niggas in tight shit i'm in the fucking matrix
it's looking like a sign of the revelation
'bout time of the return of the fucking greatest
i got all these patients man how come they aingt patient with me
they just think i want the money why
when i can't take it with me
y'all don't do it for the love for the love not
they gon' find out who you are just admit 'fore you get admitted
say what you living about
fuck you gon' tell me
do you remember how you started out though
you looking lost now
fake it 'til you make it
take your little paper book
when you look in the mirror your credibility's gone now
i'd rather be hated on for who i am
than to be loved for who i'm not
that's word to doc
in the beginning a few of the people who had a problem
i was this good scoffed i just shook off
probably reminded you of the first time you saw tiger woods golf
never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
but based on how i ascended see how plain it was now they want me to jet
no one really gave a fuck about my descent 'till i took off
mistook me because i look soft
but i stood tall i just follow the 
so i rose and grew balls told these hoes to screw off
decided opposing you is what i'm 'posed to do alls
i did was say what i'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
and had you on pins and needles when i spoke to you all
you felt my pain it's almost like i poked voodoo dolls
and i hope my spirit haunts the studios when i'm gone
my picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
and fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of lou rawls
karma's headed for armageddon the drama setter
i'm going in already got an arm and head
and whoever said words are just words
can't hurt me more than i give a fuck
even if my image ends up taking a personal hit
whoever i hurt or whatever bridges i burned
in this bitch and whatever bitches feel like
they didn't deserve what they get
and whatever consequences come with every verse it's worth it
so doc turn the beat on whose turn is it to get murdered on it
and here's to all the years i spent toeing a line to overtime
as sure as a mole is blind in my mind
i'm still underground as a groundhog and i'm a go for mine
like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
i'm starting to slow and these lines full of nines
i just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
all i needed was someone to co - sign been a 
assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole time
day one set with the blasters give me the orders i spray uh
pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint gun
aingt no one safe from non - believers there aingt none
i even make the bitches i rape cum
i'm waiting on someone to say something
dre make the bass bump and let the tape run for old time's sake
i spit it straight through this is take one
the moment you're waiting for has come but
take two of these in
the morning overdose
i just need y'all to try to bear with me for a minute
while i talk about the pages of my diary
i remember when i got started my intention was to win
but a lot of shit changed since then
some more friends became enemies in the quest of victory
but i made a vow never let this shit get to me
i let it pass so i consider that part of my history
and i'm strong; financially physically
mentally i'm on a whole 'nother level
and don't forget that i came from the ghetto

when i didn't have it you provided
don't be surprised that i built an enterprise
and my house got a view of the city like a highrise
i'm just talking to my diary i'm just talking to my diary
when i open up my book i think about the world later
no ink in the pen no lines on the paper
i'm just i'm just i'm just talking to my diary

you biting your lips toes twitching and she crinching
steaming up the bathroom 'til we left it a sauna

then lay your seat way back like it was vintage
while i hit the highway and slowly puff on this spinach
camouflage emotions got your feelings wide open

that's why i make the type of music you can pump in your jeeps
so buck my sound i put it down for the underground
i got the women cause i'm slamming jamming
got it going on this time for this new producer to rise
so open your eyes i think you better recognize 
once again it's the man with the masterplan
they call him sam and i  
i remember days on the blocks where i slang slung played punk cops
and mad props cause i ran with hard rocks 
from napalms to uzi's i made g's 
them build up enough luther by keys
no gang affiliation yo i stood on my own to pulling capers
i'm a sneaky slick nigga i never had to pull the trigger 
i mack and on top and that i'm used to staying wicked with just 24 - 7
you can ask my ex - hooker
but now i'm on some new improved shit
making hits stacking chips now everything's legitimate
i flipped the scrip a long time ago on the five - o
when i had to scope with this new way to make my cash flow

bitches give my mad rep nothing but the brazen off tempo
thinking they can get my loot i never trip to knock the boots

all eyes on the price so i think you better recognize 
the long - awaited detox trick
'cause maybe i don't wanna stop maybe i don't wanna quit
maybe i like hoes maybe i don't want a wife maybe i'm psycho
maybe i'm crazy maybe i'm strapped right now just maybe
maybe it's a relapse maybe i'm high right now where the weed at

i'm on 'til i'm on a island
my life's riding on the autobahn on autopilot
before i touch dirt i'll kill y'all for kindness
i kill ya my natural persona's much worse
you've been warned if you've been born or if you conform
slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
leave him with his socks hard bottoms and bloomers on
and hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
y'all niggas' intellect mad slow y'all fags know
claiming you banging you flaming
bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
me and shady deaded the past so that basically resurrected my cashflow
i might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
though i aingt wrapped tight
my blood type's the '80s
my '90s was like the navy you was like the bradys
you still fly kites daily
catch me in my mercedes
bumping ice ice baby  screaming shady 'til i die
like i have a pair of dice life's crazy
so i live it to the fullest 'til i'm swayze
and you only live it once so i'm thinking 'bout this nice nice lady
wait no stop me now 'fore i get on a roll 
let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is 'cause she's kinda famous
and i hope that i don't sound too heinous when i say this
nicki minaj but i wanna stick my penis in your anus
you morons think that i'm a genius
really i belong inside a dang insane asylum cleaning try them trailer parks
crazy i am back and i am razor - sharp baby
and that's back with' a capital b with' an exclamation mark maybe
you should listen when i flip the linguistics
'cause i'm gonna rip this mystical slick shit
you don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
'cause after i spit the bullets imma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
imma kick the ballistics so get this dick imma live this
living life in the fast lane
moving at the speed of life and i can't slow down
only got a gallon in the gas tank
but i'm almost at the finish line so i can't stop now
i don't really know where i'm headed just enjoying the ride
gon' roll 'til i drop and ride 'til i die
i'm living life in the fast lane 
living life in the fast lane 
my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
at war with' a bottle as captain morgan attacks my organs
my slow flow is euphoric it's like i rap endorphins
i made a pact with the devil that says i'll let you take me
you let me take this shovel dig up the corpse of jack kevorkian
go 'back and forth in more beef than you can pack a fork in
i'm living the life of the infinite enemy down
my tenement too many now to send my serenity powers
spin 'em around entering in the vicinity
now was called eminem but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
chewed him up  and spitted him out
girl giddy - up now get get down
he's looking around this club and it looks like people are having a shit fit now
here little t - t - trailer trash take a look who's back in t - t - town
did i s - st - stutter motherfucker fuck them all
he shuts the whole motherfucking walmart d - d - down every time he comes a - r - r - round
and he came to the club tonight with' 5'9 to hold this bitch down
like a motherfucking chick underwater she tryna d - dr - drown
shawty when you dance you got me captivated
just by the way that you keep licking them dick sucking lips i'm agitated aggravated
to the point you don't suck my dick then you're gonna get decapitated
other words you don't fucking give me head then i'm have to take it
and then after taking that i'm a catch a case it's gon' be fascinating
it's gon' say the whole rap game passed away on top of the affidavit
graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
to michael jackson' activator 
meaning i'm on fire off the top might wanna back up the data
running over hip - hop in a verbal tractor - trailer
homie they sick you can normally ask a hater
don't it make sense these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
drop in the lap of a tax evader 
now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
what girl i'm the crack - a - lator
percolator to this party be my penis ejaculator later
tell your boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
you rolling with a player you won't be exaggerating when you saying you're
life in the fast lane 
pedal to the metal
