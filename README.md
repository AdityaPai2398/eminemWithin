# Rap-Generation #eminemWithin
char-by-char generation of rap lyrics using LSTM and CMU pronunciation dictionary.
Trained on Eminem and Dr. Dre lyrics.

## Data Collection
scraped lyrics all songs of eminem from AZlyrics using Beautiful Soup. since I required more data, scraped lyrics of Dr. Dre too as he is the inspiration of eminem and their rapping style is similar.

## Data Manipulation
removed special characters to make the model just learn characters and their sequences. kept '\n' as it will learn when to end a single line rap. <br>
reversed characters of each line  in data to make the model learn reverse english. this way the last word (after predicting the word char-by-char), the rhyming word can be selected and the rest of the sentence can be formed of the basis of that word.

## Model
2 LSTM layers of 512 nodes each followed by a fully connected layer to predict a character. <br>
Categorical cross entropy loss, Adam Optimizer <br>

## Output
Some extracted lyrics generated by the model: <br>
